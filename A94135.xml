         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S the wind in that doore <hi>Orthodox?</hi> Are you become ſo deplorately blinded, and yet honoured with the reputation of a wel-founded <hi>Roman Catholique?</hi> Is it poſſible that any Roman Catholique can ſwallow the ſweet Pill (but moſt deadly poyſon) of hereticall Pravity, to aſſevere ſo diſtinctly as you have now done, and to believe withall ſo confidently as you now pretend, the power of ſecular Princes, or of our Holy Father himſelfe, as a temporall Prince, doth clayme a kind of Birth-right by lawfull derivation, Immediately as it were from the Almighties throne, and without exception?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthodox,</hi> The wind blowes where it liſts <hi>Hetrodox;</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be now transformed into a <hi>Baertimeus,</hi> or turned blind as a Beetle, in this Theologicall Argument, whether I have taken down a drachme, or ſo much as only a drop of hereticall poyſon in this dogmaticall aſſertion; I neither intend to ſhew my ſelfe ſo ſelfe-conceited, neither purpoſe to looke ſo big upon the tip-toe of my own private ſpirit, as to deprive your critick faculty of any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113906:4"/> faire and free liberty, to cenſure the verdict of my Poſition at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting when the Sun ſets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> Fall then roundly and cloſely to the main of the firſt Propoſition, I barre all manner of byes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthodox,</hi> Your will be done <hi>Hetrodox:</hi> Then firſt I take this for granted, that all Dominion and Servitude, that all Power in the Prince to command, and all obligation of Subjects to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme with promptitude all due and requiſite obedience unto the juſt and lawfull beheſts of their lawfull Princes, by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is grounded and built upon one of theſe foure Baſes; <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Inheritance, Donation,</hi> or <hi>Law of Armes;</hi> I mean <hi>Sword-Law,</hi> and right by valiant <hi>Conqueſt;</hi> So that all Princes advanced to the glorious Throne of ſacred Supreamacy, or ſupreame Principallity, by any one or more of theſe foure Baſes of State, are condignly to be enrolled and regiſtred in the moſt noble Canon or Calender of lawfull Princes: And all ſuch Princes (I religiouſly profeſſe) in my conſcience are crowned with <hi>Authority and Power immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> from God, to command, to enact Statute Lawes, to exact due Tributes, to heare and determine cauſes, to inflict capitall and other corporall puniſhments, to impoſe Pecuniary Mulcts of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Statutes, upon all their naturall Subjects <hi>without exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> By theſe laſt words, <hi>without exception,</hi> whether mean you <hi>exception of Subjects,</hi> or <hi>exception of Power,</hi> or <hi>exception of Cauſe?</hi> If the firſt, ſurely your Propoſition is erroneous; For what <hi>Power</hi> can ſecular Princes carry over Clerics, exempted (as you know right well) from temporall power, at leaſt by mans law, as it is held by all Catholique Authors; yea, by Gods Law alſo, as before our parting I hope ſo materially and ſubſtantially to verify, that you ſhall be enforced to confeſſe your error, to cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> and glad withall, to deliver me your weapons in this Field.</p>
            <p>If you mean <hi>exception of Power,</hi> your Propoſition is Hereticall; For no <hi>Power</hi> of any Chriſtian Prince or Monarch, can be free frome ſubjection (in ſome ſort) unto the power of Chriſts Vicar, thr univerſall Paſtor and Head of all Chriſtians, whether Princes o-private perſons. If you mean <hi>exception of Cauſe,</hi> your Propoſitir on doth ſmell very ſtrong of like peſtilent contagious hereſie; Fot it is the doctrine of ſacred Scripture, and holy Councels, That ſpirituall cauſes are not ſummonable, nor bound or tyed to ther Courts of <hi>Layics,</hi> not compatible of tryals in the Kings-Bench, or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113906:4"/> Court of Common-Pleas, but in Conſiſtorian Courts, and before Eccleſiaſticall Tribunals alone; in which point all the Doctors, as well Divines as Canoniſts, with unanimous conſent do jump and accord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthodox,</hi> Not ſo <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> ſaving your deep, and, as well may be avouched, your infinite reading: D. <hi>Medina</hi> for one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and holds hard for the contrary; yet a Doctor <hi>Marſhaled</hi> in the ranke of ſolid, Catholique and Claſſicall Authors, He delivers for poſitive doctrine, that exception or exemption of Eccleſiaſtics in temporall crimes and cauſes, is not commanded or preſcribed of Almighty God, in the whole volumne of the Bible;<note place="margin">Medin. de Reſtitut. q. <hi>15.</hi>
               </note> His expreſſe and formall words be theſe, <hi>Videtur oppoſitum eſſe verum &amp;c.</hi> The contrary aſſertion ſeemes to go forth, and bravely to march with flying Colours of truth; for the purpoſe; That after aboliſhing of the old Law, there is not found any one obligatory precept in Gods word, for the exempting of Clericks or Eccleſiaſticks from the power of the ſecular arme and ſword; I rather chooſe to affirm &amp; maintain, that in former ages Clericks have obtained, and for the times preſent with great happines do enjoy their exemption by the munificent Grants, by the gratious Charters, by the indulgent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of their noble Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> again, <hi>Deni<expan>

Namely, that Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks are exempted, at leaſt by mans law, as it is held by all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Authors; in which words you grant and acknowledge by a kind of tacite and implicite confeſſion, that all Catholique Authors hold exempting of Clericks, not warrantable by Gods Law: with all the former Authors <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> concurres, or to ſay better, he precurres them all, <hi>Manifeſtum eſt quod ista omnibus imperentur, &amp;c.</hi> Who doth not ſee that all ſorts and degrees of Subjects, (not onely Seculars but alſo Regulars and Prieſts) are included within the circle of this Precept, and muſt come under the Lee of this Apoſtolicall Rule? So that neither God himſelfe, nor his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appoſtle who treats of <hi>Secular Power</hi> from the mouth of God, hath exempted or excepted any ſort or degree of Subjects from the lawfull power of ſecular Princes; But what quarrell have you to pick, or what exceptions can you take to the word <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> Not few <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and more perhaps then your Eares are well able to brooke, or your Stomach to digeſt: For this word may be taken two manner of wayes; Firſt, it may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that Princes as they are Soveraigns and Superiors, have a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and abſolute power <hi>immediately from God,</hi> to command their Subjects; that is, the commandement of Subjects due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their lawfull ſuperiors and liege-lords, is <hi>immediately</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended or derived from God himſelfe; Now this I grant is true, and of no good Chriſtian to be denyed or gainſaid: For how can he be Supream Lord of Subjects, who hath no lawfull power from God to command his People, or he a Subject, who is not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the bond of due obedience? This duty the Lord himſelfe commands in holy Scripture. The light alſo of naturall reaſon clearly ſhewes the ſame duty, that every Subject ſhould render and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113906:5"/> yeeld entire obedience to his own lawfull Superior; But now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>Orthodox,</hi> the ſame word <hi>immediately</hi> may import and beare this other ſignification, that ſecular Princes challenge this or that People for their own People and Subjects, by the immediate grace and gift of God. For example, The moſt Chriſtian King doth, or may challenge the French in this latter ſence; The moſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King doth, or may lay claim to the Spaniſh in the ſame con-conſtruction; The moſt illuſtrious Re-publique of <hi>Venice</hi> doth or may pretend the right of Domination over the <hi>Venetian,</hi> in the ſame ſignification of the word: So that by conſequence, all the ſaid three moſt renowned States, are inveſted <hi>immediately</hi> from God, with abſolute <hi>Power</hi> over their ſeverall Subjects and native People: Now this latter conſtruction of the word, is dipt in a deepe die, to carry a baſe tincture of manifeſt falſehood; I appeal herein <hi>Orthodox</hi> to ſome of your own premiſes, for in the opening or dilating of your Propoſition, you fairly affirmed before, that <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> fall to great mens fortunes and ſhares foure ſeverall wayes, namely, by <hi>Election, Inheritance, Donation, Law of Armes, or right of Conqueſt;</hi> Now theſe Titles (all men know) are not divine or of God, but humane or of men. If any one therefore ſhall aſpire and aſcend to the ſummity or ſublimity of temporall dominion and power over this or that People by the ſteps or degrees of thoſe Titles, the ſaid power falles not as it were into his lap, or to his lot <hi>immediately</hi> from God, with ſome <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but by mediate proceedings and actions of State, namely by meanes of Election, as in the caſe of <hi>German Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> and Kings of <hi>Polonia,</hi> or by meanes of inheritance, as in the caſe of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and French Kings; or by meanes of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as in the caſe of Princes holding their States in Fee, or by meanes of juſt Warre and Conqueſt, as in the caſe of Duke <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and other Chriſtian Princes, Conquerers of the Holy Land by the dint of Sword. If the moſt Chriſtian King were now queſtioned, by what right he holds the Crown and Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> would he anſwer, by right from God? No verily, but by right of hereditary ſucceſſion. If the <hi>Venetian</hi> Duke were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, by what right he claimes the Government of that moſt illuſtrious Principality and State, would he anſwer, by divine right? No ſuch matter, but by <hi>election</hi> of the Senators; And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lyes the difference between the Eccleſiaſticall Principality of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113906:6"/> our holy Father, and all other ſecular or civill Principalities: the Pope hath power over all Chriſtians, not onely by the univerſall right of Gods holy ordinance, whereby ſuperiors have right of rule and command over their Subjects, but likewiſe becauſe by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate gift of God he is Lord of all Chriſtians, as of his right and proper vaſſals; And howſoever he is advanced to the ſublimity of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chayre, by the immediate ſuffrages and election of the moſt illuſtrious Lords the Cardinals: yet his power is not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſaid Lords (as water is derived from a Spring by Pipes or Channels) but immediately from God, the perpetuall and inexhauſtable Spring or Fountain of all Power, who ſaid to <hi>Peter, Paſce Oves,</hi> feed my ſheep: the reaſon, becauſe the Pope may go whiſtle for any the leaſt power to alienate any one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or City, or individuall perſon, from his Apoſtolick Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; neither is it poſſible for the Pope to be true Pope, and not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all degrees of Chriſtians, as Chriſts Vicar; the reaſon, becauſe the Title of his power is divine.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, Kings and ſecular Princes may be deprived of their Subjects in whole or in part, tis in their own power, hand, and free liberty to make alienation of ſome City or whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to bring the ſame under ſome forraign Prince his yoake, and thereby to ſtrip themſelves of all power over the ſaid City or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; The reaſon, becauſe they have no juſt and true title to their power from the immortall God, but only from creatures of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity. In like manner, no mortall creature, no ſublunary power, is able to pull ſo much as one feather out of the Popes powerfull wing: It is neither the Colledge of Cardinals, nor generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, nor Pope himſelfe, that can derogate, or diminiſh, retard or impaire the leaſt portion of Papall power; The reaſon, becauſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall power proceeding <hi>immediately</hi> from God, is totally and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally free from Subjection to the will of creatures. In ſecular Principalities, experience teacheth us many times the contrary events: the point of their power is now and then rebated by rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious inſurrections of their own Subjects, or by cunning practices and hoſtile acts of ſome more potent Princes, yea, ſometimes Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall Principalityes are changed into free States: and on the contrary, free States into Monarchies, becauſe their power hath no immediate derivation from God, but mediate from the conſent and aſſent of men.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:113906:6"/>
            <p>To be ſhort. If Secular Princes be not gifted with Power and Authority from God <hi>Immediately</hi> over the perſons of pure Laics, how much leſſe are they armed with power over Eccleſiaſtick Eſtate, exempted from the ſaid power by the Law of God and Man? whereof I hope to make before our parting evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Your Propoſition therefore might have been better cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and put downe in theſe termes: Secular Princes are not gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with any Sword of power immediately from God over their Laic Subjects, but onely by meanes of ſome lawfull Title from their people; and againſt Clerics or Eccleſiaſtics within their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, they have not ſo much as a ſhort dagger or a ſmall bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin of Power and Authority to draw forth, neither from God nor Man.</p>

               <hi>Orthod.</hi> With great authority and confidence, <hi>Hetrod.</hi> you have taken the paines to utter and ſay juſt nothing: The word <hi>Immediately,</hi> againſt which you take ſo great a ſtitch, is uſed by <hi>Navarrus,</hi> a moſt grounded and Catholic Doctor.

               </note> 
               <hi>Poteſtas Laica praedicta, &amp;c.</hi> The ſaid Secular power comes immediately from God, for this reaſon, becauſe men are furniſhed with Naturall Reaſon engrafted by God himſelfe; and this Natural Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Power to be due and requiſite over man, <hi>propter bonum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen eorum,</hi> as tending and availing to their better, more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and more orderly Government. <hi>Navarrus</hi> for this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or verdict rather, citeth and produceth <hi>Durandus, Iohan. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſienſ. Almanius, Gerſon,</hi> with ſome other Catholic Authors, and then drawes the whole to this faire head: As the Precept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Murther is by the Law of Nature <hi>Immediately</hi> from God, ſo the Authority of Secular Princes againſt all Delinquents, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon them capitall penalties according to the merit of their cauſe, for the tranquillity and better Politie of the State or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, is immediately from God alone.</p>
            <p>True it is, that ſome before others are mounted to the Chaire of Soveraigne State, as it were upon the backs and ſhoulders of men, I meane, by humane meanes; as either by Inheritance, by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Donation, or by the Law and Right of Armes, as I have laid it downe for an over-ruled Caſe and Principle in Common-Law; And now I avow punctually for the purpoſe; The very

               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Now then, to take you up at your own weapon; As Papall power is immediately from God (ſaith <hi>Hetrodox</hi>) howſoever the Popes election is acted by the ſuffrages and votes of Cardinals, who are but men, ſo howſoever the meanes or manner, whereby the Prince is aſſumed or exalted to his throne, be humane or of men, his power alſo (if the Popes be ſo, or any ſuch at all) muſt needs be of God.</p>
            <p>An example in Philoſophy will make this point cleare; The reaſonable ſoule is not infuſed or inſpired of God into mans body, before the ſame body be fitted and accommodated with all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans or inſtruments, and with all naturall diſpoſitions, of nec ſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty required to make the body a fit receptacle for the ſoule: Now all theſe abilities and meanes are termed by Philoſophers <hi>Conditio ſine quâ non,</hi> the condition without which the body at no hand can be framed or built for a convenient Houſe, Tent, or Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, for the immortall ſoule.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113906:7"/> In like manner, howſoever the meanes by which a Prince is mounted to his throne, are but humane, or of men, (and that is the condition without which the Prince is not inſtalled in his throne) yet his power to rule and govern the Stern of State, is <hi>immediately</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>But I muſt here take you <hi>Hetrodox</hi> at your word, as one convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the power of truth it ſelfe, and acknowledge (ſo that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus confitentem reum</hi>) the word <hi>immediately</hi> may be taken (as you contend) in two ſeverall ſenſes, and this for the firſt, Princes have immediate power from God to command their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that is to ſay, the precept or law that bindes to the obedience of Princes our lawful Superiors and Lords, is <hi>immediately</hi> from God; and this I grant is true; now albeit you here ſeek to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the word <hi>Power,</hi> and the word <hi>Command,</hi> yet according to your own ſence and acceptation of the words, they both do ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame thing, to all intents and purpoſes; And in very deed, the word <hi>Power</hi> would be better expreſſed, by the word <hi>authority,</hi> or <hi>jurisdiction;</hi> For ſo the originall <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which directly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies authority to command, would be tranſlated and turned, for the avoyding of equivocation.</p>
            <p>Briefly; The doctrine by me propounded in theſe two words, <hi>immediately,</hi> and <hi>without exception,</hi> is not only Catholique and ſound, but likewiſe juſtified by verdict of your own mouth; And howſoever you pretend (to what purpoſe I cannot ſee) to marke this doctrine with a black coal, yet by the juſt judgement of God, you leave it neither ſtamped nor ſmeared in face or front, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of odious impreſſion and ſtigmaticall reprehenſion, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give it a kind of ſtronger back, and more pithie, with your own approbation.</p>
            <p>As for the long parallel, or (to give it a better title) the large compariſon which you frame between the Layic and Eccleſiaſtic power, it is altogether extravagant, needleſſe, and from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for whoſoever contends for the Layic power to be <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> of God, and without exception <hi>in temporalibus,</hi> doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly, nor by conſequence deny Eccleſiaſtic power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>immediately</hi> from God, and to be without exception <hi>in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualibus,</hi> which we Roman Catholiques muſt affirme, and are bound to uphold.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Whereas two contradictories are not poſſible to be true both at once, in one and the ſame reſpect; you have given and granted the honour of truth to both: For firſt you affirm that Princes, as higher powers and ſuperiors, are inveſted with power immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God to command their Subjects; Then as one preſently, even in the turning of a hand, repenting himſelfe, and falling from his Tenent, you ſing out and warble theſe notes of a contrary ayre: If the power of ſecular Princes over Laics be not immediately from God, much leſſe over Clerics; and a little after, The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition therefore would ſtand more firm, it would go more ſtraight and bolt upright in theſe tearmes; Secular Princes have no power over their Layic Subjects immediately from God: Now either the one of your two Propoſitions muſt be true, and the other falſe, or elſe <hi>Hetrodox</hi> who holds them both for true, muſt needs be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a viſible and palpable errour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You confound title of power with power it ſelfe, which are directly diſtinct, both for matter and word; Title is <hi>Conditio ſine quâ non acquiritur Poteſtas.</hi> It is the condition, without which power is not ſetled in the Prince; Power is that authority and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction wherewith Princes are inveſted immediately of God ſo ſoon as they are entitled thereunto by man: This was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared before, by a ſimilitude taken from the reaſonable ſoule; and your ſelfe <hi>Hetrodox</hi> have been forced to grant it againſt your will, for you paſſe it currant and uncontrouleable in the Popes caſe, and affirm that howſoever his Holines is elected and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Papacy by the votes of men, yet he receives power to ſit in <hi>Peters</hi> Chayre, and to govern the Ship of the Church imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of God.</p>

This makes the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Grand-Seignior,</hi> of the great <hi>Cham,</hi> and of the Perſian Monarch, to have not ſo much as the leaſt dependency upon the Popes power; And yet I trowe, you know it is a power, and that an abſolute power; to which cauſe (if I take not my marke amiſſe) you crowded and ſlily ſhuffled in the word chriſtian, when you ſaid, the Pope had power over all chriſtians; wherein you ſpeake this language, this in effect and no more; That all are ſubject, not <hi>ratione poteſtatis,</hi> in reſpect of power, but <hi>ratione chriſtianitatis,</hi>

            <p n="4">4. A Prince (you ſay <hi>Hetrodox</hi>) being demanded by what right he holds the Regall Scepter, and poſſeſſion of his Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, will never avouch the law of God in his defence thereof, but either his right of inheritance, or elſe his right by the law of juſt warre, and of lawfull Armes, or of election, or of donation; from which you inferre, that his power is not immediately caſt upon him by Gods gracious gift; I muſt now be bold to re-joyne, and come upon you with an expreſſe negative. The Prince (be you <hi>Hetrodox</hi> well aſſured) will never ſuffer ſo lame, ſo looſe, &amp; ſo diſhonourable ſtuffe to ſcape his noble heart or lippes: but if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall be more bold, then obſervant and reſpective, to boord his Highnes with ſuch a queſtion, how came you Sir by that Soveraign power and authority to govern and command your People? He would readily and peremptorily ſhape him this religious and Prince-like anſwer, I received it as the <hi>immediate gift of God;</hi> and asked or interrogated againe, who gave him the title and inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſuch power? his anſwer (to ſtop the interrogators mouth) will be this in a word, I received it of men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All Subjects that live (ſay you <hi>Hetrodox</hi>) within a Kings domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, are not his lawfull Subjects, <hi>immediately</hi> by Gods holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but all chriſtians are immediately the Popes vaſſals: Now you know (and no man better) that Correllatives are <hi>ſimul natura,</hi> in a condition of relation by their proper nature the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; If therfore the ſecular and laic Prince have any power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his naturall Subjects to live in the ſtate of Subjects imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, then Obligation of all his naturall Subjects to yeeld their due Prince all due obedience of lawful Subjects, is in like manner imediately from God: And as the title of a ſubject to this dominion, or breaking of ſome penall Statute, or committing ſome notorious offence within this dominion, makes me ſubject unto my Soveraign Lord the King, or the State: So the character of a chriſtian makes me a ſubject unto the Pope, at leaſt as we Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics believe and teach: And as this man is not my King or Prince but by his inheritance, election, &amp;c. So none can be ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſtiled Pope, but by Canonicall and authenticall election of the Cardinals. Now then as the character of Baptiſme (ſay we) markes a man for the Popes lawfull Subject, <hi>in ſpiritualibus;</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

            <p n="6">6. Again you have put down and vouched one point for poſitive and certain, which is by catholic Doctors held to be dubitable and queſtionable, namely, whether the Popes power and authority, when he is gone the beaten way of all fleſh, doth reſt in the Church, or whether the Church remaines void of ſuch authority and power ſo ſoon as the Pope breathes out his laſt gaſpe?

            <p n="8">

Why ſir, the Pope is not Lord over the people of this or that Province, as they are Inhabitants of the ſaid Province; he is onely their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor as they are Chriſtians: In regard whereof he hath no power to alienate any one province, or anyone ſingle perſon. Firſt, becauſe all provinces are not belonging to Chriſtians, neither in Freehold tenure nor in ſockage tenure, nor in any other lawfull tenure. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe howſoever a large part of Chriſtendome takes knowledge of the Pope as of their ſuperior, and lives within the vergerie and precinct of his papall power, nevertheleſſe that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of the Pope is not founded nor grounded upon any right of dominon; And where no dominion, there no alienation; I ſpeak of ſuch Princes as are not ſubject unto the Pope <hi>in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralibus.</hi>

            <p>And is the chief Biſhop no Lord, when he parteth ſtakes with Chriſt himſelfe in the honourable Title of our Lord, and without addition is called our Lord, even as Chriſt himſelfe is called our Lord? No doubt, he is a great Lord, according to the opinion, ſenſe, and ſervice of his devoted creatures: But let his height and elevation be taken by the ſtaffe of that common Title, and ordinary ſtyle, that he honours himſelfe withall in his letters pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall, when he writes himſelfe <hi>Servus ſervorum,</hi> the ſervant of thoſe that ſerve God, and where then is his Lordſhip, or what is then become thereof? What dominion in the ſervant of ſervants? No; we are to hold and beleive the contrary, becauſe our ſweet Saviour Jeſus hath delivered and taught us the contrary: Said he not unto his Diſciples and Apoſtles, once upon a time at conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.</note> which of them ſhould be the greateſt, <hi>The Kings of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles doe raigne over the Gentiles; but amongſt you my Diſciples there ſhall be no ſuch matter; but let him amongſt you that is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, be as he that ſerveth;</hi> To the ſame purpoſe he ſaid to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,<note place="margin">John 20.</note>

            <p n="10">10. Your tenth errour layes it ſelfe open and perſpicuous in a moſt pernicious, nice, and tickle aſſertion; That neither by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, nor by the whole Corporation and body of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, the chiefe Biſhops power can ſuffer the leaſt diminution; and yet by the Subjects, the ſecular Princes power may be plumed of the braveſt feathers. Touching the former branch of this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I have ſignified my mind before, that I have no humour to draw into diſpute, whether Papall power, when death ſeizeth upon the chiefe Biſhop his mortall body, doth remain in the Church, or whether the Councell be above the Pope: only this I hold to be indubitable, that <hi>In cauſa haereſis eſt ſupra Papam,</hi> in caſe of Hereſie the Councell is above the Pope; and that in caſe of ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous offences the Church never wanted requiſite and convenient remedies for the maintenance of her own rights and priviledges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popes themſelves. But what ſhall I ſay to the other branch of your aſſertion? Let us meaſure the truth thereof by the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of common reaſon: tell me then, what People hath power to crow over the authority and power of any Soveraign and abſolute Prince? Surely none, for by what authority? Who dares now ſhew himſelfe upon the Stage, to broach and to draw the veſſell of ſuch peſtiferous and ſcandalous doctrine? What? Is there a power in any people to depoſe their lawfull and Sovereign Prince? To pare the nayles of his power? To make a Soveraign Prince <hi>In eſſe,</hi> no Prince <hi>De facto,</hi> but a meer Subject? To pull the Imperiall Crown from his head, the royall Scepter out of his hand, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple robe, or mantle royall from his ſhoulders, and to kick him after a ſort, or to tumble him down from his Regall Throne? Can there be a more deſperate device, more dangerous and forcible Bellows to blow the coales, and to kindle the flames of moſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113906:12"/> deteſtable rebellions, of odious and inſupportable Seditions, of dreadfull conſpiracies, of <hi>Abſolom</hi>-like, or <hi>Judas</hi>-like trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the very bowels of the State? I am loth to be a medler or a ſtickler, and to have any hand in choaking or drowning the venemous ſeeds, or in quenching the peſtilentiall ſparkes of theſe horible combuſtions with inke of Pen; It is for noble and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall Princes themſelves, in theſe caſes intereſted <hi>In Capite,</hi> to rowſe up their brave ſpirits, and (if the matter muſt needs come to blowes) to draw the Sword in defence of their own ſo juſt and honourable a quarrell: I muſt confeſſe, it ſorts well with a Princes honour, to rule out his abſolute power by his grave Councell of State, and the wholſome Lawes of his Realmes and Kingdomes, as it concernes and beſeems the chiefe Biſhop himſelfe, no leſſe to ſquare and to compaſſe out his power by the councell of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, provided they be no way intereſted or ingaged and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born with paſſion, but ſtill have an eye to reflect upon the good of the Pope, and the good of the Church; alwaies directed by the laudable Canons, and the venerable Councell. For howſoever the abſolute Prince perhaps, <hi>Non tenetur ſuis legibus quoad obligatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> is not liable to the conſerving of his own lawes by plain termes of obligation, <hi>tenetur ſaltem quoad directionem,</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perhaps or peradventure, he ſtands bound to the conſerving of his own Lawes, at leaſt for the office and duty of direction.</p>

You aſſume, or preſume rather, that Monarchicall Rule of Laic Princes, is changed ſometimes into free States, and free States of Laics, are ſometimes changed into Monarchies: But as for the Church, you affirme that ſhe is not ſubject like the Moon, unto the like mutation and change.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if the caſe be put concerning Chriſt himſelfe, who is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream &amp; ſoveraign Paſtor of the Church, there is no queſtion but his Monarchie ſhall ſtand, remain and endure for ever, without all change; <hi>Becauſe of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end;</hi> which comes not by reaſon of Title or no Title, (as you ſeem to inferre) but by reaſon that Chriſt himſelfe is not ſubject unto the leaſt inward or outward violence, the proper cauſe of all ſuch mutation and change.</p>
            <p>But make the caſe to concern Chriſt his Miniſters, and who can deny the Church was governed at the firſt after the form of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick? Let men read the fifteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there <hi>Peter</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes

            </p>
            <p>Whether S. <hi>Peter</hi> was then inſtalled in the primacy, like the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Duke, who holding a moſt honourable preheminence and ranke in that moſt illuſtrious and renowned State, is nevertheleſſe reſtrained and kept in a State of Subjection to the whole body of that Republick; I leave the matter to be diſcuſſed and ſifted, by thoſe whom it may or doth chiefly concern. It ſufficiently makes for my purpoſe, that whereas Decrees were publiſhed in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, under the name of the republick, or whole Aſſembly; now edicts and conſtitutions are publiſhed under the name and authority of one alone: And whether any mutation or change is imported thereby, ſpeak your ſelfe <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> by whom it hath been denyed before.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Your laſt errour is palpable in inferring this for a reaſon of difference between the two powers: The rule of the one is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from God, whereas the title of the other hath no ſuch immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate derivation: here I ſay you miſſe the marke, and erre from the ſenſe two manner of wayes: For if by Title you meane the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there is no ſuch matter; becauſe neither is the Title the power, nor the power the Title. And if by Title you underſtand the means or manner of reaching to the height or top of power, the one is no leſſe humane or of men then the other: The Conclave it ſelfe ſhall never be able to prove me a lyar in this point: but I here put on a ſtep further.</p>
            <p>The power Eccleſiaſtic is not in ſo preciſe manner, or direct degree immediate from God, as the power ſecular: The reaſon, Becauſe it is in the man Chriſt, or in Chriſt as man; to wit, as in the Head of the Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 22.</note> to whom alone it is immediately communicated of God; <hi>All Power is given to me in Heaven and on Earth.</hi> So that all Eccleſiaſtick power, which the chiefe Biſhop challengeth and aſſumeth to himſelfe, is at beſt hand but a Delegate power, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and committed to him by Chriſt: For Chriſt being that Mediator between God and man; as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, it muſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113906:13"/> follow by good conſequence, that God gives the ſuperiority and power Eccleſiaſtic to the chief Biſhop, not immediately without meanes, but mediately, or by meanes: <hi>id eſt, Per Chriſtum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorem,</hi> by the Mediator Chriſt, or by the meanes of Chriſt; and this mediate power of the Pope is no Soveraign or Princely power, but a Vicariate or deputed power; it imports not Dominion and Soveraignty, but rather Service and Miniſtery. And hereupon the chiefe Biſhop takes it for no diſparagement, for no vility, for no abatement in his high and honourable Stile, to be titled the ſervant of Gods ſervants, a Paſtor, a Biſhop, &amp;c.

               <hi>Hetrod.</hi> You go too farre <hi>Orthodox;</hi> I neither can bear in my ſelf, nor forbear you any longer; The paſſage which you alleadge and quote out of <hi>Paul,</hi> treats of power in a generallity, and teacheth obedience of Subjects to their lawfull Soveraigns and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors in groſſe, or to Superiors of every ſort and degree, and of every calling, to be by Gods own Ordinance; It doth not directly ſhew, that ſuch and ſuch perſons are ſubject in their callings to the ſecular Prince, by the immediate Ordinance of God. It is not denyed that all power is of God, but ſome power is immediately of God; Such was the authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſuch alſo now is the Popes authority and power. Some other power is likewiſe of God, but mediatly, as by meanes of ſucceſſion, or of election, or of ſome other humane title. And as for <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> teſtimony upon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> paſſage, it is thus to be anſwered; The holy Father affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not in his teſtimony, that Prieſts and Monks are bound by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> precept and authority, to render obedience unto ſecular Princes, but rather unto their own Superiors whomſoever. It is no leſſe true, that Eccleſiaſtics are bound to keep and obſerve all ſuch Lawes politick and civill, as are not repugnant unto Eccleſiaſtic Lawes, and ſuch as are neceſſary for common commerce between Eccleſiaſtic and Laic perſons: For in the courſe and cariage of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall affaires (as Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> writeth unto the Emperour) the Church makes good uſe of the Lawes Imperiall: Howbeit, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtics are not bound and tyed to ſuch obſervance of ſecular Princes Lawes, by way of any force, but only by way of direction: that is to ſay, <hi>Vi rationis, non vi legis,</hi> by vertue and right of reaſon, but not by vertue and right of Law: Let me give this inſtance for example, The temporall Prince commands a tax to be ſet upon the price of corn; in this caſe Eccleſiaſtics are bound to buy and ſell at ſuch price: not becauſe they are bound to the ſaid law, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are bound to buy and ſell at a juſt and lawfull price, and becauſe in reaſon of State, as alſo in common reaſon, the price tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any lawfull Prince within his own Teritories, muſt paſſe the muſter of lawfull prices. Howbeit, ſay it comes to paſſe, that ſome Eccleſiaſtic breaks the ſaid law, yet can he not for ſuch delict or tranſgreſſion of the Law, be fetcht <hi>Coram nobis,</hi> before the civill Judge or Magiſtrate by <hi>Sub paena,</hi> or by any other of the Kings Writs, nor can he be puniſhed by the Laic Prince, to whom he is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113906:14"/> not ſubject, but by proceſſe out of his own Eccleſiaſticall Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors Court.</p>

               <hi>Orthod,</hi> Let me have leave <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> to give you the ſtop in your full careere, know you <hi>Hetrodox</hi> what you ſay? Is the Apoſtles text, <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of power in generall, and not of ſecular Princes power? The beſt is, you avouch it with a bare affirmative, you ſend it forth but bare and naked, without any upper Garment, not ſo much as a Waſte-coate either of double or ſingle ſtuffe, I meane, without any one reaſon of proofe at all. But how can it be poſſible, that <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks of power in generall? Is it not his full and whole ſcope in that Chapter, to ſtop the mouthes of thoſe, who ſlandered the Chriſtians of that age and time, to be ſeditious routs, to profeſſe very ſcandalous and pernitious doctrine? to wit, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were not bound to the obedience of ſecular Princes, but were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all ſecular juriſdiction? S. <hi>Paul</hi> then ſpeakes to the point, and ſaith, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers, i. e.</hi> to ſeculars of eminent place and high charge; yea, the very epithite <hi>Sublimioribus,</hi> higher, is a plain tearm of reſtraining the word <hi>Power;</hi> And that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did foſter and fancy none other conceit or meaning, I appeale to the judgement and authority of <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> of <hi>Thomas,</hi> of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> of <hi>Theophilact,</hi> expoſitors of the ſame text, who agree not in conſent like harpe and harrow, but jump and accord all in this one cleere expoſition, that <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks of ſubjection to ſecular Princes: What mean you then <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodox,</hi> to deny this Orthodox expoſition, and to contend that S. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks of power in generall, and of papall power in particular, which in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time was hardly crept out of the ſhell, at leaſt not crept up to any degree of ſublimity, but lay lowly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and louting after a ſort, (if it was then at all) in the perſon of one poor, one ſimple, one lowly Apoſtle. Moreover, if S. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks of power in generall, how can theſe words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame context, <hi>(Give tribute unto whom yee owe tribute, for he doth not beare the Sword for nought)</hi> be dexterly and aptly applyed or fitted to power in generals? The husband I trow hath power over his own Wife, the father over his own child, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant over his own Schollars; what? Have theſe alſo power to exact lawfull tribute, and to condemne their Subjects unto cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall death?</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:113906:15"/>
            <p>Our Saviour, to ſhew that his Kingdome was not of this world, as he ſpake to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and that his power was none of thoſe higher powers, meaning no terrene or worldly Power, was pleaſed to uſe this argument:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>If my Kingdome were of this world,</hi> then would my Miniſters fight without all queſtion; but now, becauſe my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants fight not in my quarrell, that I might not be delivered to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for certain my Kingdome is not from hence.</p>
            <p>Exacting of tribute, and bearing the Sword to take vengeance on thoſe that do evill, is directly ſo proper to the ſecular Prince, and to his Miniſters, that by no meanes it can or may be applyed to any other power: S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore ſpeaks there in particular, and not in generall; And howſoever it may ſeem, that ſome things there ſpoke and taught by the Apoſtle, may by Allegory and in a ſpirituall or myſticall ſence be applyed to the ſpirituall Prelate; as by name, that he beares the Sword, <hi>viz.</hi> of Gods word, or the Sword of Excommunication; and that he exacts tribute, <hi>viz.</hi> of Teares and repentance; yet whenſoever any dogmaticall point is handled, it is needleſſe to ſeek a knot in a ruſh, needleſſe to hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Allegoricall conſtructions and ſences, moſt of all needleſſe to pick out contrary ſenſes, as in our preſent caſe. This doctrine makes very much for the firm eſtabliſhing of the ſecular Princes authority thorow all <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> &amp; therefore in this argument or ſubject, we neither ought nor need to runne and fly unto allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but are to ſtand firme, and to hold us faſt by the proper and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſenſe of Scripture.</p>

For whereas men conſiſt of ſoul and body, ſo long as we continue in this life temporall, and have uſe of temporall things, as good ſtayes and ſupporters of this life: We ought in matters pertaining unto this life, to be ſubject unto powers, that is, unto men by whom humane affaires are ordered and adminiſtred, with ſome degree of honour: thus farre S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> In which paſſage I obſerve theſe three things.</p>
            <p>The firſt, S. <hi>Paul</hi> as he is there expounded by S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſpeaks for the particular of ſecular Princes, and not for the generall, as you pretend. The next, S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> himſelfe, a Biſhop, of Epiſcopall authority and juriſdiction, there ſaith, <hi>Nos,</hi> Wee, even wee Biſhops muſt be ſubject unto the powers. The laſt, S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> uſeth an emphaſis in the word <hi>Oportet,</hi> we ought, which word implyes a neceſſity of ſubjection.</p>
            <p>By all the fore-alleadged authorities it well appeares, how great difference &amp; large diſtance there lyes, between your aſſertion, and the doctrine of the holy Fathers, &amp; by name of S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light and bright ſhining Sun, of all Divines. And what ſay you to that of <hi>Thomas? Circa primum, &amp;c.</hi> Touching the firſt, we are to conſider, that ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the primitive Church deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (at leaſt in word and aſſertion) ſubjection to terrene powers: They pretended and ſtood upon their Chriſtian liberty, obtained and purchaſed in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to thoſe words of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>If the Sonne ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed;</hi> Now
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113906:16"/> the liberty granted by Chriſt, is that ſpirituall liberty, by which we are freed from ſinne, as it is written, <hi>The law of the Spirit of life, which is in Chriſt Jeſus hath freed me from the law of ſin &amp; of death: whereas the fleſh yet remaines in bondage, and under the law of ſin.</hi> The man therefore once freed by Chriſt, ſhall never be obnoxious to ſubjection, either ſpirituall or carnall, <hi>when Chriſt hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Kingdome unto God, even the Father, and hath layd aſide or put down all rule, with all authority and power;</hi> In the mean time, ſo long as wee are clothed with corruptible fleſh, we muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto Lords carnall; as it is written, <hi>Servants be obedient unto your Maſters according to the fleſh,</hi> which is the very ſame that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher Powers.</hi> Now higher powers are men placed in high and honourable dignities, to whom by law and order of juſtice we owe ſubjection; <hi>Submit your ſelves to al manner of Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be unto the King as ſupream, or unto Governours, as unto them which are ſent of God.</hi> And whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To the higher powers,</hi> it is a kind or manner of ſpeech indefinite; meaning that we muſt be ſubject unto all ſuch perſons, <hi>Ratione ſublimitat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> officii,</hi> in regard of their high office and place, though the men themſelves are evill. <hi>Servants be ſubject unto your maſters, not only to the good and courteous, but alſo to the froward.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> a <hi>Religious;</hi> who for all his religious orders, made no bones to ſay, <hi>Oportet nos, &amp;c.</hi> We muſt be ſubject. His words doe neither admit nor need any comment or gloſſe, he ſpeakes not with a Barre in his throate, but with a clear voice, and like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: the Prince of ſcolaſtick and catholique Doctors.</p>
            <p>And who dares deny S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to be a catholique Doctor? His clear verdict upon this paſſage of <hi>S. Paul</hi> is extant with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aprobation and applauſe: <hi>Facit hoc ideo, &amp;c.</hi> It is the Apoſtles purpoſe here to teach, that Chriſt hath not brought his Lawes into the Church, of any intent or purpoſe, to repeale, to reverſe, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null, or aboliſh the lawes and rules of politick government; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reduce the order and frame of civill government unto a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forme of inſtitution. S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore ſpeaks there of politick or civill power, not of all power in generall, (as you <hi>Hetrodox</hi> are pleaſed to avouch, comprehending therein the Popes power, and I wot not what powers beſides) but only of ſecular power. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113906:16"/> how foule an errour it is, to expound holy Scripture according to a mans own private ſpirit or fancy, yea contrary to the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, I referre you to the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 4. And whereas you ſtrive for the Popes power to be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from God, and not mediate by election of Cardinals; but in a certaine correſpondence to the immediate power of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> from the Lord; If you can ſhew and prove that God at any time hath ſpoken to the chiefe Biſhop, elected by the Cardinals, face to face in a fiery-buſh, or in a rod, as he hath ſpoken of old to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> it ſhall be ſubſcribed and confeſſed for my part, that not only the Popes power, but alſo his election is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God. But if God in former times hath ſpoken, and yet ſpeaks to the chiefe Biſhops, when they are elected (as you <hi>Hetrod.</hi> would bear us in hand) let me be anſwered to this one queſtion: How then are the Conclaves neceſſary? What need ſo many am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious plots and practiſes? What need ſo many hot and vehement canvaſes? What need mighty Princes by their Agents to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, to mediate, to ſhuffle and cut with Cardinals for the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome one or other of their own Subjects, Patriots, Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, or Creatures? What need many other ſtrange devices and ſtratagems to be ſo pragmatically and prepoſterouſly coined, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to haſten the untimely birth of many partiall and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate Elections? In a word, what an idle and ſuperfluous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Lord Cardinals is that, wherein the Popes election is made, when his Holineſſe is immediately elected of God, juſt to an hayre forſooth, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were elected? What new doctrine is this? Almighty God, as the prime and ſupream cauſe, permits the ſecond cauſes to act and worke in their kind, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their efficacy. And howſoever in the election of Popes and other Princes, he is aſſiſtant after a more ſpeciall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, for a common and generall good; yet he never violents or enforces the liberty of elections. Nay, rather he expreſly ſhows and makes known (I ſpeake of Gods ordinary courſe, <hi>Quando de revelatione non conſtat,</hi> when there is no manifeſt and apparent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) that his divine will and pleaſure is, to have this or that individuall perſon to win the ſpurres, and to prevaile in the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before all others, as it pleaſed him to provide and take order in the caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> yea ſometimes for the puniſhment
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113906:17"/> of our ſinners, Almighty God ſuffers a wicked Prince, and as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Pope (if not much worſe, and more wicked) to be advanced by courſe, and order of election: but when the election is once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate, God then gives the Pope, (as we Catholiques profeſſe) a Vicars power of Chriſts own inſtitution, and gives the Prince that power which was inſtituted by the author of mans nature, with nature it ſelfe; nor can I here ſee any ſuch difference, as you <hi>Hetro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> do ſeem to inferre, That Princes are elected by men, and the Pope is not elected by men, but by God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were elected.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks clearly of Princes and politick Magiſtrates, of whom alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe ſpeakes, (which I have ſufficiently explained before) you ſpare not <hi>Hetrodox</hi> (which is your next groſſe errour) to affirme, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> there han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles not power of the ſaid Princes and Magiſtrates in particular, but ſpeaks only of power in generall. Now Sir, can it ſtand with any probability or poſſibility, that where S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe treats of ſecular Princes, and their power in particular, there S. <hi>Paul's</hi> moſt faithfull expoſitor doth make the ſubject of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> diſcourſe to be of power in generall?</p>
            <p>Secondly, thoſe powers whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> tearms higher powers, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thorow his whole Sermon calles by the name of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Magiſtrates; I mean ſuch Princes and Magiſtrates as enact politick lawes, bear the weighty burthen of the Common wealth, to whom Tribute is due, and by the Apoſtles precept is to be given, upon what ground of reaſon? Forſooth becauſe they are the chief workers and preſervers of peace and plenty to the whole land; they make and maintain warres in the Subjects defence; they ſee and cauſe due puniſhments to be inflicted upon all ſeditious and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered breakers of the Kings peace, debaucht and wicked perſons: Tell me Sir, who are thoſe by whom th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe worthy workes, and the like are done, but ſecular Princes and the civill Magiſtrate?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Doth not <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> directly teſtify, that whereas the Apoſtles were famed and defamed rather to be ſeditious, to preach diſobedience unto Princes, and to the common lawes? S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore by way of precept hath delivered all the dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call points couched in the ſaid Chapter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> affirmes, that aſwell here, as in other
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113906:17"/> places S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands every ſubject and ſervant in the whole State, to be ſubject no leſſe unto his lawfull Prince, then ſervants in Families are ſubject unto their private maſters.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, what meanes <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> by thoſe words, <hi>Facit autem hoc ideo, &amp;c.</hi> It is the Apoſtles purpoſe and ſcope to teach, That Chriſt hath not eſtabliſhed his lawes in the Church, thereby to nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie civill States and Regiments, but rather to ground and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them upon a more perfect and rectified forme: theſe words do plainly teſtifie, that he ſpeaks of ſecular Princes in particular, unto whom all Subjects owe their obedience, according to the politick lawes of the State.</p>

And from hence it is evicted, that ſuch authority was not knit by any eſſentiall connexion to the office of the high Prieſt, for had it been connexed in ſuch a manner, no doubt <hi>Moſes</hi> would never have ſo wickedly robbed and cozened <hi>Aaron</hi> of ſuch a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, as the moety, or one halfe of his authority: Firſt of all, leſt he ſhould be noted to wrong his brother <hi>Aaron</hi> in ſo high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, namely, by ſtripping him of no leſſe then a whole moety, or one halfe of his entire charge: again, becauſe exemption of Clerics, being as you pretend, ſo grounded on Gods Law, <hi>Moſes</hi> was to leave the whole courſe, exerciſe, and execution of judgement, in the hand of <hi>Aaron</hi> their ordinary and competent Judge: laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> thereby ſhould have gained the more free ſcope and greater liberty to ſerve in other politick imployments and affaires.

            <p>Now then, <hi>Orthodox</hi> upon what ground, what authority, what warrant dare you affirme, that in the Primitive Church there was no diſtinction of Court, and that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was the firſt by whoſe conſtitutions it was ordained and provided, that Eccleſiaſticks were priviledged to have their tryals and ſentences before their Prelates?</p>
            <p>But in plain truth (at leaſt if you can abide to heare the truth) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was a Prince, who by uſurpation of more then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent authority, ſought indeed to heare the cauſes of Eccleſiaſtics, and thereby intruded himſelfe to cut as it were their ſpreading Combes; for that reaſon <hi>Menua</hi> in all ſubmiſſive humility petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> to leave the cogniſance, at leaſt of civill cauſes, unto the Biſhop: to which Petition the Emperour was pleaſed to give both gracious care, and princely grant.</p>
            <p>How true it is, that <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> uſurped exceſſive authority, it is evident by his practiſe; for he both ſhufled and cut the cards, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded himſelfe to bridle the Clergy, to tye and hold them ſhort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtake by his Lawes, as well in ſpirituals as temporals: who ſo liſts to read the titles <hi>De ſanctit.

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:113906:22"/> Howbeit you know <hi>Orthodox,</hi> it is the doctrine of all Divines, and Canoniſts, yea of <hi>Couaruvias</hi> himſelfe too, that by Gods own word the judgement of ſpirituall cauſes belongs only to Biſhops, and to the higheſt Biſhop, as to the ſupreame Judge: whereupon both before <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> and after, the ſacred Councels have debarred and reſtrained the clergy by expreſſe and peremptory inhibition from procuring any tryals before ſecular Judges, as in the councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> (beſides divers other Councels) it is more then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt:<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>In which firſt part of the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinians Novel,</hi> I may not paſſe diverſe points untouched: this for one, That <hi>Menua</hi> is glad to come on his knees, and to make humble ſuite for this priviledge: then ſurely his Churchmen had no ſuch exemption before from God himſelfe, or <hi>Iure divino</hi> by Gods law: for had the good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch had that ſtring to his Bow, by Gods holy Ordinance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, doubtleſſe his humble begging and earneſt Petition for this humane priviledge, had been by his leave and yes too <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> no better then direct and voluntary ruſhing into ſinne: This for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> grants not <hi>Menua</hi> the Court in any abſolute ſtraine or terme; but only allowes him to give judgement or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence without any clamorous noyſe, and without any formall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in writing; a courſe clean contrary to modern practiſe in our Eccleſiaſticall Courts, where commonly more clamour and noyſe, more Advocates, Proctors, Notaries, more Offices and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, more chargeable Fees are paid for Tranſcripts, breviats, Bookes and ſuch like inſtruments, then are in Courts of ſecular
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113906:23"/> juſtice: This for a third, that <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> puts down the reaſon whereby he was induced to grant ſuch priviledge, to wit, that Clerics not diſquieted nor diſturbed with clamours and noiſes of Courts, might more diligently and freely attend upon their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine offices, and Miniſteriall Functions: This for the fourth and laſt, <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> grants no abſolute, but only conditionall priviledge.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point obſervable in the Novell, that in criminall cauſes of civill nature and kind, meerely temporall, without any ſmack or relliſh of ſpirituals, (which <hi>Couaruvias</hi> expounds in theſe words, <hi>Quae ſpiritualia non attingunt,</hi> ſuch as touch not the hemne of the ſpirituall garment) Church-men within the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſhall be tryed and judged by competent ſecular Judges; and through the whole Empire beſides, by the Prefects or L. Preſidents, in their ſeverall <hi>Provinces;</hi> and that moreover with a certain limitation or ſtint of time, nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, that within the tearm and ſpace of two moneths, the matter ſhall be drawn to a head, and ſhall come to a finall iſſue or end, and that ſentence being once ſped or paſſed againſt a Cleric, by the L. Preſident of any Province, the Preſident ſhall not proceed to execution, before the ſaid Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric is degraded, and quite diveſted of his prieſtly, or ſacerdotall dignity by the Biſhop, according to the laudable cuſtome and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner in ſuch caſes. The Emperours own words are thus directly couched in the Novell; <hi>Si tamen de criminalibus conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur, &amp;c.</hi> but if a Church-man be convented or brought <hi>Coram nobis,</hi> upon ſome criminall cauſe of a civill nature, that is to ſay, ſuch as no way hath dependance, or correſpondence with Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic Regiment or Church-diſcipline; in ſuch a caſe he ſhall come to tryall (within this imperiall City) before competent Judges, and in all the <hi>Provinces</hi> before the moſt honourable <hi>Preſidents</hi> of the ſame; provided the ſuite depend or hold not above two months after the <hi>Actor</hi> hath put in his Declaration, and the <hi>Reus</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer or defence, that ſo the ſuite may have the ſhorter cut, and the more expedite diſpatch. And in caſe the <hi>Preſident</hi> ſhall find the party impleaded to be guilty in the action, and thereupon ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge him to undergo and ſuffer the puniſhment ordained and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by Law; then the party ſo judged, ſhall firſt be depoſed from his Prieſtly Orders, and Church dignities, by the Biſhop beloved of God, and after that, he ſhall come under the hand, or ſuffer the penalty of the Lawes.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:113906:24"/>
            <p>In which words likewiſe, divers points are to be obſerved; viz. That ſome offences criminall are meerely civill, meerely politic, no way within compaſſe of ſpirituall reſpect or conſideration; that crimes and offences of ſuch nature are tryable and puniſhable by temporall Magiſtrates; that Churchmen for the ſaid offences may be ſentenced and condemned to death by a temporall Judge; that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> bindes not himſelfe, or his LL. the Judges within the City of Conſtantinople, to cauſe a Prieſt or Cleric firſt of all to be degraded and after to be tranſmitted over into the hands of civil Miniſters of juſtice: but in ſuch caſe he binds only the provinciall Preſidents, himſelfe as the Soveraign, and the Judges in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> as his Commiſſioners, Delegates, or Subaltern Magiſtrates remaining exempt and free from ſuch obligation, to give order for the degrading of ſuch Delinquents before execution; that ſentence of the ſecular Judge muſt precede, and then degradation is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low before execution: for <hi>Manus legum,</hi> the hand of the lawes is the executioner of haut juſtice: from whence it is directly to be deduced, that <hi>Hetrodox</hi> hath drawn but a ſiniſter, left handed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward and perverſe conſtruction of <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> Novell, in bearing us in hand, that Churchmen for offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The third point, or branch of the ſaid Novell, that in caſe a Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics offence be of Eccleſiaſticall nature, namely, ſuch as requires and calles for juſtice by ſome eccleſiaſticall cenſure or penalty, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113906:24"/> the offence is meerely Eccleſiaſtic, ſuch as requires the cenſure and correction of the Church, then ſhall the Biſhop beloved of God, take due contemplation of the nature, quality, and merit of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; the right honourable Judges reſiding and exerciſing their charge in the ſeverall Provinces, ſhall beare no hand, and ſtrike no ſtroake in the buſines, neither as head nor foot; for it is not our pleaſure or mind at any hand; that civill Magiſtrates take any cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance at all of ſuch caſes, becauſe they are to be ſifted, ſcanned, and tryed by eccleſiaſticall proceedings, and the faults of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents in that kind, are corrigible only by Eccleſiaſtic cenſures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſacred Canons, which our lawes imperiall do not diſdaine to imitate.</p>
            <p>In which branch or context of the Novell, theſe few heads come in like manner to be obſerved; that ſome offences are meerly eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, and annexed to the clericall order: that when the holy Canons and ſacred Scripture make it lawfull for Prelates to inflict and award the ſaid penalties, they alwaies intend it of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call offences: that ſuch judgements and penalties are to be paſſed without ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now in this large diſcourſe diverſe things occurre and concurre worthy of obſervation, in favour of the point which I here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: The firſt by name, that <hi>Emanuel</hi> is honourably commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and highly praiſed by <hi>Nicetas,</hi> for a moſt noble and pious Prince. The next is, that for the reformation of monaſticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline he revoked the repealed and annulled Act, or law of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus;</hi> which was not done out of paſſion, or out of any envious or venemous humour againſt the Church, but only out of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, to worke and effect a timely reformation of the Church. The third is, that <hi>Emanuel</hi> renewed the law of <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> annulled by <hi>Baſilius,</hi> becauſe <hi>Nicephorus</hi> was directed &amp; guided by moſt prudent conſideration to enact and eſtabliſh the ſame Law; which becauſe <hi>Emanuel</hi> did ſet on the own firſt feet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, therefore <hi>Nicetas</hi> gives him the honourable adjunct and ſtile of <hi>Cordatus Imperator,</hi> an Emperour of an upright, right couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and right ſincere heart. The fourth is, that never any man ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his mouth to complaine or to declare himſelfe grieved-or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt <hi>Emanuel,</hi> for the re-eſtabliſhment of the ſaid law. The laſt is, that as well by this Act of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> as by the Acts of <hi>Nicephorus, Baſilius,</hi> and other chriſtian Princes, it is lawfull and free for chriſtian Princes (as it is now practiſed in act) at pleaſure to eſtabliſh, and re-eſtabliſh the like lawes; and that immunities whether paſſant or dormant, do grow and flow <hi>Ex privilegio prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipum,</hi> from the ſweet ſpring of Princely priviledges. I paſſe over diverſe matters, <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> as namely, that you pick out of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and ſcrape any thing together, which may but ſeem to make for your purpoſe, and omit or leave out all that makes againſt your cauſe; as alſo, that you build and worke upon texts of no weight or importance, upon priviledges caſſed and annulled; in like manner, that you diſclaime and reject authorities of the moſt noble and chriſtian Emperours, their moſt holy Lawes and priviledges, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet annulled, neither by cuſtome, nor by any ſuperior power.</p>

               <hi>Hetrod.</hi> I feare <hi>Orthodox,</hi> you will breake your wind, or at leaſt runne your ſelfe out of breath in this argument, if you may be ſuffered to have your own ſwinge, I will therefore take down and coole the heate of your diſcourſe, as it were with a ſprinkling or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:113906:31"/> two of holy water: Anſwer but one example, and you ſhall give me more then meane ſatisfaction: when certain Proceſſes were preferred and preſented on a time to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, againſt ſundry eccleſiaſticall perſons, what was his gracious and Princely reſponſe? <hi>Vos à nemine, &amp;c.</hi> No mortall man hath power to judge you of the Church, but you are to be judged by God alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthod.</hi> What aime you to inferre upon this one inſtance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hetrod.</hi> That Clerics or Churchmen are not ſubject unto ſecular Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthod.</hi> You ſhoot both too farre ſhort, and too farre wide of your marke: That Princely reſponſe was only a kind of exceſſe, wherein the noble Emperour endeavoured to demonſtrate an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-weight of his exceeding benignity and piety towards the Church: the gracious eye of his internall judgment lookt another way then you ſeeke to inferre: For if that reſponſe had been true, and according to his inward perſwaſion or beliefe thereof, then Clerics without all queſtion might not be judged by their own Prelates: For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> there ſaith, <hi>Ad Dei judicium reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamini,</hi> you Churchmen are exempted by the benefit of reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be judged by God alone: which doubtleſſe is a blurre to your learning, and a groſſe <hi>Non ſequitur</hi> to inferre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hetrod.</hi> Beleeve me <hi>Orthodox,</hi> you labour to crown the great Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> with garlands of homely praiſes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, when to make him renowned and glorious for his benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and piety, you paint him forth, as a maſqued and cunning lyar: But Sir, to the end you may plainly ſee in what heighth and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pole,<note place="margin">Hiſt Eccl. lib. <hi>10.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>

            <p>Where it is to be noted, that as temporall and ſecular Princes are Gods in reſpect of their People, ſo Prieſts are Gods in reſpect of Laics, though they be Princes, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſticks not here to affirme: and upon this foundation the great Emperour very ſafely grounds his concluſion; that Prieſts have power to judge Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, but Emperours have no power at all to judge Prieſts: Now if this great Emperour of the world hath acknowledged, that he held Prieſts as in the ranke of Gods, that he could be no judge of Prieſts, and yet might himſelfe be judged by Prieſts, how much more ought other inferior Princes and States confeſſe the ſame in word, and acknowledge the ſame in fact? Nor doth it follow in right conſequence, that Prieſts cannot be judged by their own Prelates, but rather the contrary: for ever and at all times the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior judgeth in Gods name, from whom he receiveth authority and power: Nay rather God himſelfe then ſitteth in judgement by the mouth of his lawfull Miniſter for the exerciſe of judgement: So when a Biſhop judgeth ſome inferior Eccleſiaſtic, or when the Pope himſelfe judgeth a Biſhop, it is God that judgeth by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, or mediate worke of his appointed and approved ſervant: This was therefore great <hi>Conſtantines</hi> beliefe and perſwaſion, that Biſhops, who in reſpect of Laics are Gods, cannot be judged by Laics who are but men, and not Gods, in reſpect of Prieſts: Again, that, it reſteth in God alone to judge Clerics, viz. by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or mediat act of his great Vicar; as in like ſort ſecular Princes who in reſpect of their ſecular People and Subjects are Gods, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be judged by the ſaid People, being but private perſons, but only by God, by meanes of his Vicar the Prieſt, who in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is called God, to wit, in regard of the ſecular Prince: In that only ſence the Lord ſaid to <hi>Moſes, I have made thee Pharaohs God,</hi> namely to judge, to chaſtiſe that cruell King with my rodds, my ſore judgements. And for ſome good proofe of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that power to judge &amp; cenſure Biſhops is in the hand of the Pope, it is to be clearly ſeen in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> own practiſe againſt <hi>Caecilianus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whoſe cauſe (being accuſed &amp; promoted by the Donatiſts) <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelfe durſt neither ſift nor touch, but only ordered that <hi>Caecilianus</hi> and his cauſe ſhould

            <p>In which words firſt I obſerve, that here <hi>Conſtantine</hi> hath an eye only to ſpirituall cauſes, for ſo much as here he ſpeaketh of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtics,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113906:32"/> not as men but as Gods, by vertue of their ſpirituall power to bind and looſe: Secondly, that he meddles not here with any humane judgement, but expreſſely with the laſt judgement of God; Thirdly, that he ſpeakes not of any God which makes the whole number of the Aſſembly, but of the God who ſtands in the Aſſembly of Gods; even of that God, who is the ſupream and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Judge: This of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> therefore is a kind of ſpeech in exceſſe, as before hath been ſaid: And as for your anticipation, (that when the Prelate judgeth, God himſelfe then judgeth by the Prelate, and therefore not man, but God himſelfe is the Judge) I muſt be bold to tell you, <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> it lacks juſt weight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not be allowed to go currant. For by the ſame reaſon it ſhall hold good and ſtrong, that when the ſecular Magiſtrate ſits in the ſeate of juſtice, it is not man that gives judgement, but God himſelfe; becauſe the Magiſtrate is <hi>Dei Miniſter,</hi> Gods Miniſter to take vengeance on ſuch as do evill: Moreover, for ſo much as all Prelats, yea, the higheſt Biſhop himſelfe may erre, (ſaith Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in many places) which likewiſe is the common opinion; yea, and many times hath actually erred <hi>In judiciis facti,</hi> in judgement of the Fact: it is therefore not abſolutely to be held, that when they judge, then God himſelfe judgeth; becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for to erre, as it is to lye: upon this expoſition of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> words, (whether his own, or the words of <hi>Ruffinus</hi>) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by a ſtraine of exceſſe in things not intelligible, you runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diverſe errours.</p>

I pray let me have it well proved by ſome plain paſſage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that for inſtance the LL. of <hi>Venice</hi> are <hi>Jure divino,</hi> the LL. <hi>Paramount</hi> of <hi>Padua, Verona,</hi> with other like Cities, and if any queſtion ſhould grow concerning the Kingdome of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> what faire title would the Venetian State alledge for the ſame? Some goodly Charter of ſacred Scripture? Surely no, but either ſome title of donation, or ancient poſſeſſion, or ſome other like humane title: Now then, if they ſhall fall ſhort in proving their title over the Laics of <hi>Padua, Cyprus, &amp;c.</hi> by divine authority, when will they prove their pretended title over Clerics by the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? I dare paſſe yet a whole degree further, namely to maintain, that all degrees and ſorts of Laics, yea, that Soveraign Princes are by Gods Law in the ſtate of ſubjection to Prieſts, and that by the ſame Law of God, Prieſts are quitted and freed from ſubjection to ſecular Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My reaſon, becauſe according to Gods holy writ and word (the poſitive law of God) prieſts are paſtors or ſhepheards to feed, and Laics, though never ſo great Princes are ſheepe to be fed; Prieſts are Fathers, and Laics are ſonnes: Now according to the light of nature (the law naturall of God) the ſheep are under tearmes of ſubjection to the Shepheard, and the Shepherd is bound under no ſuch termes to the ſheep; as the ſonne alſo lives in ſtate of ſubjection to the Father, whereas the Father owes no duty of that nature to the ſonne: moreover, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon made by <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> between eccleſiaſticall and ſecular, is moſt excellent, and uſually taken up of holy Divines:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113906:34"/> as in mans nature there is reaſon and fleſh, of which two united, the whole frame and compoſition of man doth conſiſt, ſo in the Church their eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall power, and ſecular or temporall power, of which two the myſticall body of the Church is aptly compoſed; and as in man reaſon hath ſuperiority over the fleſh, and the fleſh is never ſuperior over reaſon, except it be in ſome fit of rage, and fury of Rebellion; Againe, as reaſon directs, rules, commands the fleſh, and ſometime brings her to a kind of rack, I meane doth chaſtiſe the fleſh, and puts her to a certain pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of long faſting &amp; watching; whereas the fleſh never directs, rules, commands, nor layes any hard lawes of puniſhment upon reaſon; even ſo the ſpirituall power hath a ſuperiority over the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, by vertue and force whereof, it both may and ought alſo to give direction, to rule, to command, and puniſh the ſecular power, whenſoever it kicks, or ſpurnes, or proves refractory, or makes any breach into the incloſures of eccleſiaſticall Regiment; whereas the ſecular power is not ſuperior to the ſpirituall, nor can it direct, rule, command, or puniſh the ſame <hi>De facto</hi> in caſes of Rebellion and Tyrannie, which by Heathen Princes, or by Heretics hath been ſometimes put in practiſe: true it is, that all power is of God, but how? either immediately, or elſe by meanes: And as none is exempted from obedience due to God, ſo none is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from obedience due to the Prince, provided alwaies that a man be the ſaid Princes vaſſall or Subject, and in caſes likewiſe wherein he owes vaſſalage or ſubjection to the ſaid Prince: It is no leſſe true, that Princes (as Princes) are Gods Lievtenants, and therefore to be honoured, yea ſerved with due obedience, as God himſelfe, in ſuch cauſes and matters as lye within their power, <hi>Servants be obedient to thoſe who are your maſters according to the fleſh, even as unto Chriſt:</hi> And whereas you ſay Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> hath averred in writing, that ſecular Princes in Scripture are called Gods, he was (you muſt underſtand) induced ſo to write, of purpoſe to confound hereticall <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> who teach, that neither ſecular Princes, nor tribunals, nor judgements, nor other like politick and civill regiments are to be tolerated in the Church of God: But as that Cardinall hath written and witneſſed, that ſecular Princes are Gods in reſpect of their Subjects; even ſo he hath juſtified, that prieſts are Gods in reſpect of ſecular Princes:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113906:34"/> If you therefore <hi>Orthodox,</hi> like a good Roman Catholique would have trod in the ſteps of that Cardinall, you ſhould have taken up his weapons, and ſhould have made uſe of them againſt Heretics, not againſt our mother the Church, nor ſhould you like the Spider have ſuckt ſuch poyſon from the ſame flowers, out of which the Bee ſucks and gathers hony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthod.</hi> I am not able to reach the bottome of your deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: would you have your own concluſions to be drawne out of my premiſes? If I had been inſpired with a ſpirit of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and by the gift of Sooth-ſaying could have foreſeen, that your ſelfe or Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was to be the Champion that would undertake to cudgell my coat, I mean, ſo ſubtilly to trounce me, and to play ſuch trumps in my way, I would have directly drawn two diſtinct concluſions; the one true and built upon my own true, certaine, and infallible premiſes, the other falſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely derived from your premiſes, or thoſe of his illuſtrious Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: but for as much as the ſpirit of divination doth not harbour in my breſt or braine; I muſt only ſhape and lay in this anſwer for my ſelfe; that from the ſame premiſes which I have now framed, I would wiſh none other but mine own concluſion to be inferred, and from your premiſes, and thoſe of the Lord Cardinall, your own, or his own concluſions to be inducted: for as my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is true, becauſe it riſeth out of true premiſes, even ſo your concluon, or his Lordſhrhs (which you pleaſe) is falſe, becauſe it is inferred upon falſe premiſes, that is, drawn from a fufty veſſel of unwholſome doctrine, which the one of you two hath broached, the piercing or at leaſt running whereof I have now, as you ſee, endeavoured to ſtop with a handſome Faucet.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Will you now be pleaſed to ſee your errours? to make men ſubject unto their lawfull Prince by Gods law, you hold it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that for the right and title of their ſubjection, ſome text of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture be produced, remember it hath been declared before, that power and title to power are two different heads, that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is from God, and of neceſſity followes or comes after title: The French King rules and governes in <hi>France,</hi> not by law of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but by vertue of authority received from God: The <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Prince, I meane the Republic and body of State (howſoever you have learned of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> with great artifice and skill
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113906:35"/> to ſeale up the eyes of your own knowledge in the matter) beares not command and rule over <hi>Padua,</hi> by ſuch meanes as they firſt attained to the dominion thereof, but becauſe being impatroniſed or made Lords of <hi>Padua</hi> by humane meanes, they have it now in command (and ever had from the time of their firſt occupation &amp; poſſeſſion) by vertue of the power and right received from God himſelfe: And herein what difference can you find to lye between Prince and Pope? For if the Pope ſhall be asked, wherefore he is Pope, this will be his anſwer, becauſe I have been Canonically elected by the Cardinals to the Popedome: and for that purpoſe he will never ſtudy or ſtand to produce any teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but aske him, by what authority he gives or grants his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, &amp;c. ſurely he will anſwer, becauſe God hath given him power to forgive ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To prove that Princes are ſubject unto prieſts by the law of God, you cut out and frame a ſilly ſheepiſh argument from ſheepe and ſhepherds, Gods law (ſay you) is the law of nature; by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures law the ſheep is in ſtate of ſubjection to the Shepherd, by Gods law therefore the Laic Prince is in the like ſtate of Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Prieſt: I anſwer, the Prince is no ſheep of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard prieſt, but of the great Shepherd Chriſt; for Chriſt ſaid not to <hi>Peter, Feed thy Sheep,</hi> but, <hi>Feed my Sheep:</hi> So that your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (if it conclude any thing at all) concludes, that Princes are ſubject unto Chriſt, and not unto the Prieſt: Nay, the Prieſt as a ſheep in temporall cauſes and matters is rather ſubject unto the Prince: <hi>David</hi> gave the terme and nomination of ſheep to all his people and Subjects, <hi>Ego erravi, iſti qui ſunt Oves, quid focerunt?</hi> It is I that have ſinned, what have theſe my ſheepe done? S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words are pungent and peremptory; <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject unto the higher Powers:</hi> If then your argument hath any ſinewes to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that Subjects are bound by Gods law to yeeld obedience unto their Superiors of higheſt power; then all prieſts likewiſe (who are Subjects no leſſe then others) are directly bound by Gods law to the due obedience of their temporall Princes penall or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Lawes, at leaſt in temporall matters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The father you ſay is not ſubject unto the ſonne, if <hi>Hetrodox</hi> (his own Father yet living) were now elected King or Pope, ſhould not <hi>Hetrodox</hi> his Father, as a man and a Chriſtian be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113906:35"/> unto <hi>Hetrodox</hi> his Sonne, whether King or Pope? Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever young <hi>Hetrodox</hi> the ſonne ſhould beare due reſpect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to old <hi>Hetrodox</hi> as to the Father? Again, the Father a Laic may receive abſolution of his own ſonne a prieſt, and the ſon a prieſt may receive correction, by the authority and command of his Father a ſecular Magiſtrate: if men would not be intrapped in the ſnares of error, they muſt learn to diſtinguiſh between titles and perſons: a Prince in ſpirituals being a ſonne, in temporals may be a Father.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Touching the ſimilitude of body. and ſoul; howſoever I grant it may be true in part (as in this point by name) that a temporall Prince his power is (<hi>Per ſe,</hi> of it ſelfe) over the body; and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall prieſts power is over mens ſoules; yet your ſimilitude wants weight of truth in ſome other part, and halts down right: For temporall power (ſave only as it is exerciſed by a Chriſtian) is not ſubordinate to ſpirituall power, no not in eccleſiaſticall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall cauſes; on the contrary, the ſubjection of prieſts in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes is plainly ſubordinate unto the temporall Prince: Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments thus framed are not worth a ruſh: temporall power is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mens bodies, and ſpirituall power is over their ſoules; as the body then is directed and ruled by the ſoule, and the ſoule not by the Body; ſo he that is armed and authoriſed with temporall power muſt be directed and ruled by ſuch as are inveſted with ſpirituall power: I ſay again, ſuch reaſons are not worth a ruſh; for body and ſoule together do make one whole compound creature, which is man, whereas corporall power, and ſpirituall power make not one body, but rather two bodies and two heads: Theſe two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (as both are powers) are different in all things, and without ſubordination; as either of them is a power: neither doth <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> teach the contrary, much leſſe teach your affirmative, as who ſoever will read <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelfe, ſhall readily finde: For thus much <hi>Gregory</hi> writeth in effect, and no more, that as the ſoule is more noble then the body, ſo the ſpirituall power is more noble then the temporall, which for my part ſo long as I go for a Roman Catholic, I dare not deny.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You are much overſeen <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> to charge me with make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of this doctrine to the hurt of the Church, when I ſhould rather whet and ſcoure my weapons againſt hereticks: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

As for your exception taken to <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Lawes, and thoſe of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> it ſhall ſuffice thus to anſwer in a word: Their Lawes are ſacred, and have ever been reputed irreprehenſible; they were contrived and penned, partly upon temporall grounds and ſubjects, partly for the more ſtrict obſervance of ſpirituall Canons and Orders, partly for public benefit; and yet did never any chiefe Biſhop or High prieſt ſo kick and ſpurne againſt either of their Lawes, as you <hi>Hetrodox</hi> have now done with much diſgrace and contempt.

Coyne, or at leaſt corrupt Scripture at your pleaſure, and for your purpoſe? where find you this word in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> For they are the Miniſters of God, <hi>Ad tributa,</hi> to receive tribute? or this word, For he is the Miniſter of God, <hi>Ad vindictam,</hi> to take vengeance? The ſenſe of the latter words, I grant, is found in the Apoſtles Text; but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever men cite the words of Scripture (which indeed are Gods owne words) it is but a ſacrilegious trick to chop and change the right words, eſpecially when the genuine ſenſe proclaimes it ſelfe to every meane capacity. For example, in the firſt ſentence, <hi>For they are the Miniſters of God to receive tribute; Paul</hi> doth not ſay, That Princes are Gods Miniſters to receive tribute, but rather
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113906:38"/> by all meanes to provide for, and to procure the tranquility of the whole body: So the words are expounded by <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and other holy Fathers, <hi>Miniſtri Dei ſunt in hoc ipſum ſervientes,</hi> For they are the Miniſters of God to the very ſame purpoſe; that is, to provide for, and to procure the tranquillity of Gods people. Yea the ſame <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo, whom you ſo highly magnifie, and upon whoſe teſtimony (as you think and ſuppoſe) you build ſo ſure, is of the very ſame judgement or mind: For he reckons and ranks Tributes in the nature of Salaries given to Princes, for the labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous taske (ſurmounting the twelve labours of <hi>Hercules</hi>) which they daily undertake for the good and happy government of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And who doth not know that no ſalarie can be given to God? Princes therefore are not Gods Miniſters, <hi>Ad tributa,</hi> to receive tribute, but rather to bring their ſubjects unto a ſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> whom you quote for another purpoſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to prove, That Eccleſiaſticks have been freed from payment of tribute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the moſt gracious charters, and ſpeciall priviledges of Princes, it is in good ſooth the aſſertion of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Hiſtoricall Truth. But you impoſe and father upon <hi>Thomas</hi> more then he ſets downe, to wit, That Eccleſiaſticks are not ſo endowed and priviledged by Gods Law, whereas <hi>Thomas</hi> affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the cleane contrary: For thus he ſaith, Princes by gracious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges have exempted Eccleſiaſtics from tribute, becauſe it ſtands and agrees well with naturall equity; He means, that Princes in ſo doing, confirme the law of nature, which doubtleſſe is the Law of God.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, whereas in your laſt point you deny the power of the Church to puniſh by death; I know not where you have pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that wild and ſowre grape, except it be in the Deſarts of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Hereticks, as the <hi>Vald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

True it is, the Church never ſtrikes with any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſword, nor doth puniſh criminall malefactors by death: But wherefore? what? is it becauſe the Church wants power in that caſe? No verily, but becauſe it ſeems neither convenient nor ſuitable to Eccleſiaſticall meekneſſe; in regard whereof the Church is well contented and apayed to leave all ſuch criminall offenders

               <hi>Orthod.</hi> Nothing pleaſeth me better: Then mark well the words and contents thereof. <hi>Chriſt our Saviour, as the Sonne of God equall to the Father, is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and yet all the time that he was clothed with our mortall ſpoyles, not onely before his bitter death, but likewiſe after his moſt bleſſed and glorious reſurrection, he never exerciſed the leaſt power of a ſecular and temporall Prince.</hi>

               <hi>Hetrod.</hi> Make that good, and you ſhall win the ſpurs, or carry away my weapons out of the field.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthod.</hi> Then ſure it ſhall goe very hard, but I will here leave you unarmed in the place. For Chriſt our Saviour was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted or inthroniſed in any temporall Kingdome: <hi>Pilate</hi> makes the queſtion to Chriſt, Art thou a King? Chriſt gives the anſwer,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:113906:42"/> Thou ſayeſt I am a King: But know, O <hi>Pilate,</hi> howſoever I am a King, yet my Kingdome is not of this world, that is, not a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Kingdome. When that multitude of people who had been miraculouſly fed and ſated with five loaves and two fiſhes, were minded and purpoſed to make him King, he ſtept aſide, that he might not be taken by them, and ſo made King. He never took upon him to ſit as Judge or Umpire in any mans cauſe,<note place="margin">Tho. Aqui. in ep. ad <hi>Roman.</hi>
               </note> but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thoſe who required him to give ſentence in a certaine liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matter. Who made me a Judge over your perſons or your cauſes? Yea, he directly acknowledged <hi>Pilate, Caeſars</hi> deputy or Governour, to be his lawfull Judge, <hi>Thou couldſt not have any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over me, if it were not given thee from above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hetrod.</hi> This your ſecond Propoſition ſeems to ſhoot and have a fling at matters of State in preſent queſtion, and no meane gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyles: But in ſooth, it doth not ſo much as touch the ſame; for they treat not of temporall Kingdomes, but of Eccleſiaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; ſo that your Propoſition ſerveth onely to bewray your own bad affection and erroneous conceit.</p>
            <p>I therefore muſt give you thus much to underſtand; Very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that Chriſt as he was Man mortall, did never exerciſe any power of a temporall Prince in this world; For his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the world (it is his owne teſtimony) was to ſuffer, to ſerve, to teach men contempt of worldly wealth and honour, as alſo by his humility and obedience, to chalke out and make plaine the way or path, which leadeth to the celeſtiall Paradiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face and eyes of all proud and rebellious or diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent people. <hi>The Sonne of Man came not to be ſerved, but to ſerve, and to give his life for the redemption of many.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 20.28</note> 
               <hi>The Sonne of Man hath not whereon to lay his head. Learne of mee that I am meek and lowly in heart. Ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But your Propoſition ſhould carry this one joynt or branch more, That Chriſt even as man (in caſe he had been ſo minded) might have aſſumed to himſelfe the dominion of all temporall cauſes or matters, and made himſelfe a King or an Emperour,<note place="margin">Jam. 11. Heb. 1.2.</note> which of the two he would: <hi>The Father hath given all things into his hands and hath made him heyre of all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:113906:43"/>
            <p>Againe, It ſhould not have been put down in your Propoſition, that Chriſt after his Reſurrection exerciſed no power of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Prince, without addition of this clauſe, that Chriſt after his Reſurrection, even as he is man, hath obtained the government of the whole wold, not as a temporall Prince, but as an <hi>Eternall Prince,</hi>

            <p>But now againe, that Chriſt acknowledged <hi>Pilate</hi> for his Judge, as you affirme; I muſt be bold to tell you <hi>Orthodox,</hi> It ſmells ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ranke of errour; For Chriſt, even as man, was the High preiſt, with power of excellencie, yea he was the head of men and of Angells; ſo that he had no ſuperiour upon the face of the whole earth, neither could he be judged of any other, I meane <hi>de jure,</hi> by right;<note place="margin">Philip. 2.8.</note> (howſoever perhaps <hi>de facto,</hi> by fact, he might be brought <hi>coram nobis,</hi> upon his owne ſufferance and permiſſion:) For it was he that humbled himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he would be ſo humbled by the death of the Croſſe: And as for his words to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, Thou couldſt have no power over me O Pilate, if it were not given thee from above,</hi> (where Chriſt ſeems to take <hi>Pilate</hi> for his Judge) this anſwer I make, By power in thoſe words is meant Permiſſion; and ſo the ſenſe of that paſſage reſults to this recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, That <hi>Pilate</hi> had never been able to ſtir either one foot or fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if it had not been by Gods permiſſion. In the ſame ſenſe are theſe other words to be taken,<note place="margin">Luc.</note>

Howbeit (with your favour) that ſuch power in <hi>Pilate</hi> was extended and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched over Chriſt, it grew out of <hi>Pilates</hi> ignorance, who never knew the ſuper-excellent dignity of Chriſt, and gave ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt as againſt a private perſon of the ſame Country or Territory, whereof then under <hi>Ceſar</hi> he was L.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113906:43"/> Governour. As if a Prieſt in theſe dayes, under the name of a Laic, and in a Laic habit, ſhould be brought by warrant before a Secular Magiſtrate or Judge, he might be judged by the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer whereby he judgeth all other Laics; yet doth it not follow, that Prieſts are to come under the judgement of Laics, or that Chriſt was to ſubmit his neck under the yoke of <hi>Pilates</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthod.</hi> You deny that in the preſent garboyles (at which you wrongfully charge me to aime) there is any reference to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroll Kingdome; and yet becauſe you needs will draw me to the ſcanning of that point, I ſay it is moſt notorious, that in a manner the beſt Freehold of all temporall Kingdoms is thereby drawn into debatement. I let paſſe your <hi>Theſis,</hi> and will ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> Say the Pope now ſends forth prohibition to any Chriſtian King, or temporall State, that he or they ſhall not meddle with judging Eccleſiaſticall perſons, running into delicts of nature meerly temporall, and no way reflecting upon ſpirituall matters. Againe, that he or they ſhall not frame particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes or Lawes, concerning Lands not hitherto acquired or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to Eccleſiaſticall dominion: <hi>(In quae bonae nondum ipſis eſt jus quaeſitum)</hi> I now demand, By what authority the Pope ſends forth any ſuch prohibition? I hope, not by any authority of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes or States; for he is not Lord Paramount in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls of their Dominions and Territories. By like then he doth it by his authority of univerſall Paſtor. Now becauſe that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Univerſall Paſtor (as we hold) he holds as the Vicar of Chriſt; it was not impertinent or ſuperfluous for me to ſhew, but neceſſary to demonſtrate, what authority Chriſt himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in temporall cauſes.

                  </gap> oves,</hi> Feed my ſheep, That as Chriſt himſelfe was no Paſtor in Temporals, but in Spirituals, in like manner the Pope, <hi>Iure Pontificatus,</hi> in his right of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:113906:44"/> hath do authority or dominion in temporall matters, and in particular, when the lawes temporall, <hi>Non impedunt curſum ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam aeternam,</hi> are no hinderance in the way to life eternall, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a civill peace, are directed and leveld to the maintaining and preſerving of that State, of that Liberty, of that Dominion, wherin particular profeſſion is made of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and of <hi>Piety,</hi> as alſo to the conſerving and upholding of publ que juſtice: Now then, if I to bring proofe of all this, have laboured in the firſt place to ſhew what power our Lord Chriſt himſelfe exerciſed in temporall matters, then ſure I have ſpoken home to the point, and nothing from the purpoſe, as you cavill: Now I will have a bout or a courſe at your errours; not as in a May-game or light skirmiſh, but with Champion-like devoyre.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You confeſſe, that Chriſt never exerciſed any temporall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this world; and it is all that I either have affirmed, or can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be confeſſed. Nevertheleſſe you take upon you to teach, that I looked not before I leaped, becauſe I ſhould have ſubjoyned, that Chriſt, if it had been his good pleaſure, might by his power have exerciſed the ſaid temporall power: Now as I freely canfeſſe and acknowledge that in this point you are not our of the right way, that if Chriſt had been ſo pleaſed, he lawfully might have exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſaid power, becauſe he was not only man, but alſo God, natures being united in one perſon (and actions according to that rule in philoſophy, <hi>Sunt ſuppoſitorum &amp; idiomata communicantur,</hi> according to that rule in divinity) nevertheleſſe whereas you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that all I have delivered of this point before is to litle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and from the purpoſe; you are to take this for a ſhort, but yet for a ſufficient and full anſwer, that our preſent queſtion is <hi>de facto,</hi> a queſtion of the fact, <hi>non de poſſibili,</hi> not a queſtion of what might be, or what was poſſible to be done: Foraſmuch as the Popes authority being founded upon Chriſts example, the ſupream Paſtor, it ſufficed to ſhew what actions Chriſt himſelfe uſed for the feeding of his little flock, and not medle with another new queſtion, what actions he was able to do, if he had been willing: For doubts any man, that Chriſt was able by extraordinary power to worke the converſion of the whole world? To ſanctify the whole ſtock and race of mankind in the twinckling of an eye without ſhedding one drop of his precious blood? Is there any
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:113906:44"/> thing impoſſible with God?<note place="margin">Luc. 1.37.</note> But well aſſured that arguments drawn from poſſible to fact, are of no force, therefore I would not be ſo idle before to talke of what Chriſt was able to do in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall matters, but what he hath done in very truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This again you have ſupponed, that our Lord Chriſt as mortall man had lawfull dominion in temporall matters: But <hi>Moldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> a learned Jeſuite of your own Order, in his expoſition of theſe words, <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In cap. 27. mat.</note> hath learnedly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually proved the contrary: it may by ſome perhaps be collected, that Chriſt had the temporall dominion of the world three wayes, as he was man, 1. By right of inheritance, 2. By right of creation, 3. By authenticall teſtimony of Scripture, where in many places he is called a King, and that as he was man, which in effect is thus much; That Chriſt was King of this world, either <hi>jure naturali,</hi> by the law of nature, that is by the right of inheritance, or <hi>jure hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano,</hi> by mans law, that is by right of election; or <hi>jure divino,</hi> by Gods law, that is, by authority of Scripture: But firſt, by right of inheritance, I ſay Chriſt was no ſuch King, for albeit he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the royall ſtock of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet wee know that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (according to the fore-threatning of Almighty God) ended and came to the laſt period in <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> and was a kind of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reigning, neither was Chriſt lawfull heire apparant unto any other King: Next, he was no King by election, for it is not known that ever he was choſen King by the People, but rather that he gave them the ſlip and went aſide, when he knew they intended to make him King: It remaines then, that by authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was a temporall King, albeit he never exerciſed his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power: But in holy Scripture not a word of any ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Kingdome, but only of his ſpirituall Kingdome: Thus the great Father S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and thus <hi>Maldonate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tract. 115 in Joan.</note> agreeable to the opinion of al Divines of the beſt rank; whereupon he concludes in this notable manner: <hi>Quâ verô parte Chriſtus homo erat, non erat univerſi orbis terrarum temporalis Rex; ut &amp; Auguſtinus eo loco quem modò nominavimus &amp; omnes boni Theologi ſentiunt: Aut enim naturali, aut divino, aut humana jure rex eſſet; naturali non erat, quia regis filius non erat, quod eſt naturalem eſſe regem: Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no non erat, quia omnia ſacrarum literarum teſtimonia quae de ejus loquuntur regno, ut Auguſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113906:45"/> conſenſu res electus, et cum Iudaei vellent eum rapere ut regem facerent, aufugit:</hi> So that Chriſt as mortall man, then having no temporall dominion, he could never exerciſe the ſame: For, <hi>Non est actus, ubi non eſt ulla potentia ad illum actum,</hi> no exerciſe, where no power to bring forth ſuch exerciſe: This muſt be underſtood of Chriſt as he was man, and mortall man: For as God, no doubt (as before hath been ſaid) he was King of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords: As for the eternall power of Chriſt our Lord (for ſo you call it) which was given him after his reſurrection; there was no need to make any ſpeech or motion thereof, becauſe the preſent queſtion is of temporall Power, and not of eternall; which eternall power for certain Chriſt our Lord hath not given and left unto his Vicar.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your third errour lyes in a miſ-interpretation of two ſeverall texts, this for the one, knowing that his Father hath given al things into his hands; and this for the other, whom he hath made heire of all things: For you underſtand them both of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power, whereas <hi>Maldonate</hi> by the authority of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and of all the beſt Divines affirmes they are to be underſtood (as they ought in very truth) of Chriſts ſpirituall Kingdom, which in the Goſpell is called the Kingdome of heaven:<note place="margin">Joan. 19.</note> For if the ſaid words might be underſtood of Chriſts temporall Kingdome, then Chriſt himſelfe had not forborn (which God forbid) to rap or breathe out a lye, when he ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> &amp; againe, <hi>My Kingdome is not from hence:</hi> For he had by that means denied what holy Scripture had affirmed he was indeed, that is, a temporall King: But ſay ſtill, that Chriſt as man had temporall dominion, yet ſtill it remaines good, that he did never put ſuch temporall dominion in practiſe or execution, which as you have already confeſſed, ſo it is ſufficient for my purpoſe.</p>

We wretched creatures (mark how he reckons himſelfe in the number, then being a Prieſt, and according to ſome Authors a Cardinall) are inrowled in the cenſorian tables of Chriſt, and yet we work nothing of ſo high majeſty and honour. He for us hath born the Croſſe, and paid tribute; ſhall not we then for his honor pay tribute, but as if we were free born, &amp; the Kings naturall ſons, ſcape altogether Scot-free from all manner of tallage, poundage, cuſtomes, tributes, aydes, and ſubſidies? In this place we ſee S. <hi>Ierome</hi> not only doth not affirme, that immunities are <hi>De jure divino,</hi> by Gods Law; but he alſo grievouſly complaines (as <hi>Ianſenius</hi> teſtifies) that Eccleſiaſtics did not pay the required and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed tributes for the honour of Chriſt; as if they were the Kings el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonnes, that is, exempted by the Law of God: Who ſees not here the great and notable diſcrepance between the ſpirit of godly Saints, &amp; the blanched pretenſions of our times? But moſt of all it grieves and afflicts my mind, to ſee and heare, how men impoſe one thing upon the learned Saints and ancient Fathers, when they teach another, and the cleane contrary. <hi>Ianſenius</hi> in this place affirms, That Exemption is <hi>Privilegium Principum ſecularium, &amp; non jure divino,</hi> the priviledge of Secular Princes, and not by Gods Law.</p>

S. <hi>Thomas</hi> expounding this paſſage, uſeth a very direct and perſpicuous anſwer, <hi>Qui facti ſunt Filii Dei per gratiam, liberi ſunt in quolibet regno, ſecundum mentem, à ſervitute ſcilicet peccati, non autem liberi à ſervitute corporali;</hi> In every Kingdome the ſonnes of God by grace, are free as touching the mind, namely, from the bondage of ſin, but not free from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the body: And here three things are to be noted, 1. that S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſpeaks not of Eccleſiaſtics, (as Card. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> pretends) but of all Chriſtians: 2. That he ſpeaks not of any liberty or immunity from corporall charges or burthens,<note place="margin">S.

Was anie ſuch Canonicall and Legall courſe ever taken with the Emperor? Secondly, was it not needfull for giving the Title to whom hee pleaſed, that <hi>Leo</hi> himſelfe ſhould firſt be poſſeſſed of the ſame Title? And verily that was he never; For as Pope, and in right of the Popedome, hee was never Patron or Lord of anie ſuch Titles; and none of his Predeceſſors had ever made incurſion, or breach into the ſafe incloſures of ſo high and civill affaires: Thirdly, was it ſimply neceſſarie for the better maintenance of Chriſtendome, to give <hi>CHARLES</hi> the ſaid Title? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe; For to make him a mighty Ruler and worthy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Chriſtendome, ſufficient it was for him to be the

Farre be it from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man ſo to judge; For <hi>non eripit mortalia qui Regna dat Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtia,</hi> he that gives us Heavenlie Kingdomes, takes not away by violence the poſſeſſions of mortall men: It remaines that <hi>Leo</hi> when he ſaw (as all men did) that <hi>Charles</hi> was alreadie become Lord of the Weſt, <hi>Iure belli,</hi> by the Law of Armes, (becauſe hee was obeyed by all, howſoever hee had not ſtood in termes of open Warre and Hoſtilitie with all Nations) when hee perceived in particular, that it was determined for a finall concluſion <hi>Scito Populi Romani</hi> by full and effectuall Decree of the Romane People; then upon requeſt of the people hee crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and annointed <hi>CHARLES</hi> Emperour of the Romanes: This was <hi>Leo</hi> induced (ſaith <hi>Platina</hi> with other Authors) <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You give me thirdly to underſtand, that our holy Father the Pope hath power onely over Soules; and this you draw from that Prayer of the Church <hi>Deus qui Petro animas ligandi, &amp;c.</hi> O God who haſt given <hi>Peter</hi> the power of Pontificiall Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bind and to looſe the Soules of men: If this Reaſon hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny force, then ſecular Princes muſt have no power, but over the Soules of their Subjects, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Let every ſoule be ſubject unto the higher powers: And ſo, either you make your ſelfe too ſimple, as one who doth not conſider, that in Scripture the ſoule is taken for the whole man; or elſe you ſeeke to catch the ſimple with words of holy Church not right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: And therefore perhaps the Divine providence (to take away the like deceitfull ſleights and flie ſhifts) hath inſpired the Reformers of the Breviarie, to lib and geld the ſaid Prayer of the word Soules, which of old neither was found in the ſaid Prayer, nor ought at all there to be read, becauſe that Prayer was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and formed upon the foreſaid words in the Goſpell, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

            <p>Laſt of all you contend, that power to excommunicate is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, preſuppoſing ſin, and obſtinacie in ſin: This Doctrine is both new and falſe, you are not able to produce any Author that ever ſo taught: Sinne, I confeſſe, muſt be preſuppoſed; for Excommunication is a puniſhment, and the moſt grievous, the moſt dreadfull of all other; ſo that, no ſinne committed, no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by Excommunicarion can be inflicted: Diſobedience alſo, otherwiſe called contumacie, is (I confeſſe againe) preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a ſinne, and to Excommunicate, every ſinne gives not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant, but only that ſinne which is cloathed or clogged rather with Contumacie: For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Si Eccleſiam non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierit,</hi> If he will not heare the Church: The cenſure therefore of Excommunication cannot be denounced againſt any man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Thiefe, or an Adulterer, except firſt he be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and then he wilfully denies obedience: But betweene diſobedience and obſtinacie there is a great difference; For a man may ſtand ſtubborne and obſtinate in ſome ſin whereof he hath never beene adviſed, never admoniſhed by the Church: This man, for all his obſtinacie, cannot be ſtricken with a Thunder-Bolt of Excommunication: On the contrary, a man may be diſobedient, and for his diſobedience may be Excommunicated, albeit afterward he perſiſt not obſtinate in Diſobedience: The words of Chriſt, if he will not heare the Church, do ſignifie diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and (to ſpeake properly) not obſtinacie,</p>

               <hi>Orthodox,</hi> Fie, <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> that a man of your deepe learning, ſhould be ſo ſhallow (I will not ſay idle) in a matter ſo ſerious; So clear is the light of this fourth Propoſition, that I much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how you have deviſed and raiſed any matter againſt it whereby to make oppoſition; Now to frame the ſounder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it will be neceſſary to make ſome Explication of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it ſelfe: I ſpeake not here of all the powers which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had from Chriſt our Lord, as his Vicar in Earth, for they were two, the one of Order, the other of Juriſdiction; In this place I meddle not with power of Order, I onely define the power of Juriſdiction, and this power I ſay is meerly Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: Firſt, becauſe Chriſt our Lord never practiſed any Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113906:64"/> Juriſdiction; but this juriſdiction which Chriſt gave to <hi>Peter,</hi> is part of the ſame Juriſdiction which was practiſed by Chriſt himſelfe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is no manner of way Temporall, but meerely Spirituall: The Major (as it is called) hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before at large, the Minor is cleere by the words of Chriſt himſelfe, As the Father hath ſent me, ſo I ſend you; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence therefore or concluſion remaines indubitable,<note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, This Juriſdiction or Power is not all that Power which Chriſt himſelfe had, as Head of the Church: For he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (according to all the Doctors) communicated to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles the Power of his Exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20.</note> (as it is proved by the Authority of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and of all the beſt Divines) the Branch therefore of the ſame power, namely that Branch which was given to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is meerly Spirituall.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The power given to <hi>Peter</hi> is to Looſe and to Binde, that is, to abſolve and not abſolve ſinne, the power to abſolve or not abſolve ſinnes is meerely Spirituall; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the power of Binding and Looſing given to <hi>Peter</hi> is meerly Spirituall.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hee that defines a Habit from the end thereof, drawes the beſt Definition; Thus hath <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defined vertue, <hi>virtus eſt quae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Laſtly, If the power of Juriſdiction which Chriſt gave unto <hi>Peter,</hi> had not beene meerly Spirituall, but Temporall, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he would have taken up materiall K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. You argue from the <hi>Genus</hi> to the <hi>Species</hi> in this manner; The Popes power (as <hi>Orthodox</hi> affirmes) is meerely Spirituall; <hi>Orthodox</hi> therefore hardly believes the Pope to be ſome ſimple Prieſt, or common Curate; juſt as if I ſhould frame this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Hetrodox</hi> affirmes that a Lion is a creature, therefore <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodox</hi> affirmes, that a Lion is a little Ant or Piſmire, or this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>Hetrodox</hi> affirmes, the power of the moſt Chriſtian King is Temporall, therefore <hi>Hetrodox</hi> affirmes the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King is the Father of a private Familie, with power oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall: were it not a very abuſive ſtraine, a wrong intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if I ſhould make <hi>Hetrodox</hi> the Father of ſo ridiculous <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes,</hi> worthy to be hiſſed, knocked, and ſtamped out of all Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall and Philoſophicall Schooles? If <hi>Orthodox</hi> pretends and avouches that Papall power is meerly Spirituall, he doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth thereby avouch, that Papall power is reſtrained to a private Familie, and without all Juriſdiction, like the power of every ſimple and common Curate; but <hi>Orthodox</hi> grants it is a power over all the Soules that are ſubject unto the Popes power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe Sir, you are pleaſed to terme it Hereſie for any to affirme, that Papall power is meerly Spirituall, and I muſt make bold to tell you <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> the contrary Doctrine hath no great conformity or congruity with divine Scripture, and by name is not conformable to that faire Text, <hi>Sicut miſit me, &amp;c.</hi> As my Father hath ſent me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20.</note> ſo I ſend you my Apoſtles, the power which our Saviour himſelfe, being ſent of his Father, exerciſed in this world, was meerly Spirituall; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Popes power being a Branch of the ſame power which Chriſt himſelfe exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113906:65"/> is likewiſe meerly Spirituall: True it is, that his power (as we muſt hold) extends and ſpreads it ſelfe, <hi>Jure Divino</hi> by Gods Law, over all his owne Subjects, which Article being denied by the foreſaid Authors whom you have remembred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they were thereupon condemned; but not becauſe they maintained the Popes power to be meerely Spirituall: For it is one thing to maintaine, the Pope hath no Juriſdiction, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to affirme, that his Juriſdiction is meerely Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You alledge <hi>Navarrus</hi> to this purpoſe; That Papall power is not meerly Temporall, as if he had ſaid, the Popes power is Temporall, but acceſſorily Spirituall: Thus much is noted by theſe words, is not meerly Temporall: But know <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> that <hi>Navarrus</hi> was never ſo much overſeene, to ſuffer ſo groſſe an Errour to drop out of his learned braine, or painfull quill; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varrus</hi> affirmes the full contrary, take the file of his words as we find it ſpun and woven by his owne fingers.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113906:66"/> not a hands breadth, not an Inch of Laick power, neither in the higheſt degree, nor in the middle ranke, nor in the loweſt region: Then fourthly, that he hath neither the Act nor the Habit of Laick power, whereby he may be ſo much as enabled to exerciſe the ſame, though he ſhould never put it in practiſe, but keepe it up cloſe like a Bee in a Box, or as men ſay, like a Sword alwaies in the Scabbard: Then fiftly, that his power is Eccleſiaſticall, the ſame that was inſtituted by Chriſt our Lord, a power never heard of in the world before Chriſts inſtitution: Then Sixtly, that his Eccleſiaſticall power hath nothing at all to doe with Laick power, but is directly diſtinct from the ſame in <hi>Specie,</hi> as the <hi>Species</hi> of Gold is directly diſtinct from the <hi>Species</hi> of Lead, ſo that as Gold is not Lead, and Lead is not Gold, even in like manner Papall power is no way Temporall, and Laick power is no way the ſame with Papall power: Then Seventhly, that Papall power directly ſtretcheth out his arms to imbrace things that are Supernaturall; as Grace by name, given by his Holineſſe thorow the meanes of holy Sacraments, as Catholiques believe; and the ſame grace is meerely a thing Supernaturall: Eightly and laſtly, that Pontificiall power indirectly makes uſe of things naturall, inſtituted by Chriſt for a Supernaturall end, as water to baptiſe, oyle for that action which we call Extreame, or laſt unction,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 19.</note> and ſilver for Almes, ordaining beſides, that hee who ſerves at the Altar ſhould live by the Altar; and that no mouth of any Oxe which treads out the corne be at any time muzzeled, according to Chriſts inſtitution, for the better obtaining of the Supernaturall end: This is the power whereof <hi>Navarrus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes (as you ſeeke to beare me downe) that forſooth it is not meerely Temporall: Doth <hi>Navarrus</hi> there ſpeake of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power? Nay, doth <hi>Navarrus</hi> once dreame thereof? For albeit he ſpeakes of the uſe of naturall things, yet he cals them neither Secular, nor Temporall, nor Civill, but onely naturall; and reſtraines them to thoſe things which were inſtituted to a Supernaturall end, and not ſo far forth as they are naturall, but as they are Spirituall, that is to ſay, as they are clothed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled with goodneſſe of the Supernaturall end, according to Chriſts owne inſtitution: How then can that be true, which you charge <hi>Navarrus</hi> to affirme, that Papall power is Layick
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113906:66"/> and Temporall, howſoever not meerly Layick and Temporall? and that as Pope hee may intrude himſelfe into the exerciſing of Temporall Dominion and Juriſdiction? But with you <hi>Hetro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> it is no new or ſtrange thing (as oft it hath beene knowne and ſeene) to cite Authors for ſome opinion, who teach a cleare contrary Doctrine.</p>

            <p n="6">6.

               </gap>r the King ſo to doe, becauſe the Pope is perſwaded the Kings operations are wicked, and therefore hee will take order for the remedy and reformation thereof: For if the Pope ſhould undertake the attempt and enterpriſe to reforme all wicked men, firſt he ſhould be nothing like unto God, who many times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits wicked men to range in the waies of their own will: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he ſhould have a holy deſigne to attempt and enterpriſe the hardeſt labours of all other; as to tumble the great Turke downe from his Imperiall Throne, to pull his Regall Crowne from his Royall Head, or to convert all the Indies, or to reduce the whole World to the unity of the Church, and ſuch like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the higheſt ſtuffe; which becauſe the Pope neither will nor can performe, it is eaſie for all men to judge, that his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for all your ſayings, doth not governe all Kingdomes as God himſelfe doth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Moreover, you faine would make men believe, that as God governes all Kingdomes, not depriving any of their Free-hold, whether it be Kingdome or Power; ſo the Pope governes Kingdomes, and takes not power from Kings; Firſt, becauſe thoſe words of the Church are ſpoken of Chriſt man, and not of of Chriſt God (as the Lord Cardinall ſaith) of whom <hi>Herod</hi> was afraid that he would ſpoile him of his Kingdome; <hi>Hoſtes He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes impie, Chriſtum venire quid times?</hi> O ungodly enemie, King <hi>Herod,</hi> what ayles thee to be afraid of Chriſts comming?

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce, but we onely pronounce they are not ſubject unto the ſaid Prince; Then it remains that my meaning is, in ſuch Goods, in ſuch Cauſes, in ſuch Delicts, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly fall within the termes of Princely power, not only to take due cogniſance thereof, but alſo to ſet and appoint due order in the ſame; and what can ſuch things but meerely Temporall and Politicall matters? This hath begot and bred the Errour in ſome writers, and your Error <hi>Hetrodox</hi> in particular; In that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I contend, that Clerics are not exempt from the power of their Naturall Prince by Gods Law, you in all haſt inferre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Princes have power to make Lawes for ſaying Maſſe, and for the marriage of Prieſts! Certes <hi>Hetrodox</hi> this conſequence hath no weight, like a ſcive that holds no water; they are not exempt from Temporall Power: <hi>Ergo,</hi> in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Delicts and cauſes they are ſubject: Such equivocating Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of double ſenſe and conſtruction, which are and ever have beene the precipitating of many ſimple ſpirits into errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceipts, ought by all meanes in ſo grave and weighty a ſubject, both carefully and curiouſlie to be avoided: When I therefore ſpeake of Exception, Exemption, and Immunitie from Secular power, I muſt of neceſſity be conceived and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to meane, in ſuch Cauſes, in ſuch Goods, and in ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113906:72"/> wherein without all priviledge both Divine and Humane, of God, or man, a man ſhould of neceſſitie be ſubject unto the Secular Prince.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There be foure opinions laid to the charge of Heretiques, and rejected in this Argument, as condemned and curſed with Bell, Booke and Candle: The Fathers of the firſt opinion are <hi>Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> and <hi>Jandunus;</hi> Theſe are charged and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by ſome to teach, that Chriſt paid Tribute <hi>Neceſſitate coactus</hi> as one enforced by neceſſitie: The next is <hi>Calvins</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; He dreames that Clerics are ſubject unto the Temporall Prince <hi>Ex debito,</hi> in all Cauſes, except onely ſuch as are meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eccleſiaſticall: The third opinion calls <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> father; He makes no bones to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. My opinion is the better founded, the more true, and the more infallible; becauſe it is confeſſed by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that no Scripture, no Councell, no Canon, and none of the holy Fathers hold the contrary, as in the Defence following it ſhall well appeare; and as before hath been ſhewed out of <hi>Thomas, Auguſtine;</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> cited for the contrary opinion, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath no approbation, but only of ſome few Canoniſts; who, howſoever they affirme and maintain, that Exemption of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics is grounded upon Gods Law, doe not underſtand Gods written Law, and leſſe the Law of Nature; neither by neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence, but only by a certaine probability: As thus King <hi>Pharoh</hi> exempted all the Idolatrous Prieſts of Egypt from all Tribute, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> freed the Prieſts of Iſrael from the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113906:74"/> like burthens; It may therefore ſeeme in probability <hi>à Simili,</hi> from the like, agreeable to Decency, That Chriſtian Princes ought in like manner to exempt Chriſtian Prieſts from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tributes, and other Taxations of like nature: This Argument, I muſt confeſſe, is drawn from holy Scripture, which is Gods Law: But it ſtrongly makes againſt our Adverſaries in their Tenent, becauſe it concludes, that Secular Princes, and not God himſelfe, ordained the ſaid Exemption, the very Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I maintain; Beſides, Arguments drawn from a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude are of ſmall force, or none at all: For by the ſame reaſon it might be thus argued; In the old Law, which is Gods Law, Prieſts were permitted to marry; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is by Gods Law, that Prieſts are now married in the Evangelicall Law: And that <hi>de Jure Divino</hi> by Gods Law, is underſtood by the fore-named Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, according to this my Expoſition. I appeale to the Lord Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe in the place before alledged.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The new opinion of the Lord Cardinall, and newly brought into the Church, without any reaſon or authority, concerning this matter, hold by three ſtrings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Exemption of Clerics from Secular power is not built upon Gods written Law, becauſe it is no where comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in holy Scripture; much leſſe upon the law of nature, or the law morall, which Divines likewiſe call the Law of God, as the Docalogue, or ten Commandements, &amp;c. wherein the Lord Cardinall <hi>Medina, Conarruuias,</hi> and my ſelfe doe all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By Gods Law again, he underſtands a certain Decencie and Conformity with the examples of K. <hi>Pharoh</hi> and K. <hi>Artexerxes,</hi> and from their Examples he collects, that Chriſtian Princes are t do the ſame, but dares not ſay, they are bound to that ſtrain of Benignitie; whereupon he confeſſeth in a manner, that doubtleſſe it appertaineth unto Princes to grant ſuch Immunity or Exemption; but yet Princes are not bound to ſhew ſuch Grace by thoſe Texts of Scripture, for as much as in the ſaid paſſages there is not ſo much as the leaſt umbrage or ſhadow of any ſuch obligation to be ſeen or found.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By Gods Law, is as much to ſay, as by the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; A new device, and never heard of before; And that his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113906:74"/> Lordſhip proves thus: The Law of Nations is derived from Gods Law naturall; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is Divine or the Law of God: Then again, that it is by the Law of Nations he aſſumes, that all Nations have exempted their Prieſts; but ſhewes not in what matters, whether in their Tributes, or in other Cauſes; nor proves the univerſall, nor is able to prove the ſame, that all Nations have exempted their Prieſts; for that is falſe, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth for his opinion any one Doctor, that <hi>by Gods Law,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>by the Law of Nations;</hi> nor finally ſhewes, that Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is grounded upon the Law of all Nations:<note place="margin">Lib. de Cler. cap. <hi>19.</hi>
               </note> Let him be ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
            <p>This opinion as new, and hanging by looſe gimmals, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to nod, to totter, and to ruine of it owne accord; yet ſhall it not be amiſſe to touch in briefe divers things concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is great difference between Gods Law written, the Law of Nature, and the Law of Nations: For howſoever the Law of Nations is a Secondary Law of Nature, according to the great Maſter <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> by reaſon it is derived from Principles both of Natures Law, and of Gods Law, as in like manner the Law Civill is; nevertheleſſe it is not Divine, but only Nationall and Humane Law, neither hath any man ever thought it was Divine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every thing done by ſome Nations, cannot be called the Law of Nations, and conſequently Divine; For it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary Cuſtome of Nations to ſeeke, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Revenge; and yet Revenge hath no ground, no warrant from Gods Law; nay it is directly prohibited by our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelfe: <hi>Audiſtis quia dictum, &amp;c.</hi> you have heard how it hath been ſaid to them of old,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> thou ſhalt hate thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but I ſay unto you, love your Enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Albeit ſome Princes have granted ſuch Immunity or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in ſome particular caſe, as in the exempting of Prieſts from Tributes; nevertheleſſe the Exemption in all caſes is not in force by Law of Nations, becauſe moſt Nations neither have practiſed, nor do this day exerciſe any ſuch courſe of Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For example; In the Law of Nature all the Firſt borne (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common opinion) were Prieſts; ſhall it hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113906:75"/> be concluded, that all the Firſt-borne in the world were exempt, at leaſt from Tribute? The Lord Cardinals Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proves not a haires bredth more; which to me ſeems an anſwer little beſeeming a man of his Lordſhips incomparable learning.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If his Lordſhips Argument had any force at all to prove, that Exemption is by the Law of Nations; it ſhould only work this concluſion, that Princes ought to exempt Prieſts from Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; But our queſtion turnes not upon that hindge: No, the main queſtion conſiſts in this point; Whether Eccleſiaſtics are exempt in all Temporall matters and cauſes, without ſpeciall and gracious priviledge of their Princes?</p>
            <p n="5">5. That is called <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> the Law of Nations, which ever was from the beginning of the world unchangeable, and ſhall ſo continue unto the worlds end; as that of juſt Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Servitude; That of Marriage for the perpetuall preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man-kind; That which all Nations indifferently have obſerved, and ſtill obſerve to this day, <hi>Turks, Pagans, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Jewes, &amp;c.</hi> But for Chriſtian Prieſts to be exempted, it cannot ſtand by the Law of Nations; becauſe they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt; and beſides, All Nations have not exempted their Prieſts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To conclude: Whereas Chriſt our Lord hath ſo deepely charged all Chriſtians to practiſe Humility and Subjection; whereas alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> on his part hath abſolutely commanded every Soule to be ſubject unto the higher Powers; though Exemption had been by the Law of Nations, that is obſerved of all Nations; Wherefore might it not be abrogated, or at leaſt derogated, by Divine Law Poſitive? As Chriſt was able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale and diſanull that Cuſtome of Nations, concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of Enemies, with a new Law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hetrodox.</hi> If you have now ſufficiently fore-layd all your grounds for this preſent matter; it is time that you apply your ſelfe to your beſt Defence, and to trace out my particular Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Well remembred; you ſhall ſee mee trace them out one by one in my defence, as men uſe to trace Hares in a Snow.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:113906:75"/>
            <p>Two things I have affirmed before; the one, that Eccleſiaſtics and their Poſſeſſions or Goods are not exempted from Secular power, meaning (as hath been ſaid) in ſuch Caſes and Cauſes unto which the ſaid Secular power doth properly extend; for ſo much the word Exemption ſignifies: The other, that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics enjoy no ſuch Exemption by the Law of God, but by mans Law, without growing or deſcending to any particular; whether the ſaid mans Law be the Law of Nations, or the Civill, or the Canon Law: Howbeit my opinion is the ſame that <hi>Medina</hi> holds, and other Authors alledged for this purpoſe; That Exemption goes by Priviledge of Princes: Now to your Errours in your late and laſt oppoſition, which I find to be Eight.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſacred Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (you ſay) hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that immunity of Clerics is by Divine Law:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seſs.</hi> 25. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</note> But in the ſaid Councell and Seſſion which your ſelfe have cited, I can read no ſuch Determination: The Councell there treats onely in generall of Eccleſiaſtick Immunity and Liberty; adding this Adjunct or Epithet, <hi>Divinâ ordinatione conſtitutam,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Gods Ordinance; It doth not ſay, whoſoever ſhall affirme that ſuch Immunity in Temporals is not by Gods Law, let him be Anathema, let him be accurſed: Nor doth it determine, it is by Gods Law; but ſpeakes in a generality, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that Immunity or Exemption which is in Eccleſiaſticall and Spirituall cauſes: And how thoſe words, <hi>Appointed by Gods Ordinance</hi> are to be taken or underſtood, I appeale to the Gloſſe; unto which the Doctors are alwaies referred, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Exemption in Temporals is avouched to be appointed by Gods Ordinance, or by the Law of God: For the Gloſſe it ſelfe ſaith, <hi>Eſt de Jure Divino, id eſt, deducitur ab exemplo, &amp;c.</hi> It is by Gods Law; What is that? It is drawne from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Patriarch <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the Perſian King: Where the Gloſſe doth not meane, it is from Gods Law, as by any way of Precept; but rather, that by Princes it is granted by reaſon and occaſion of thoſe two Examples, read in holy Scripture, which is Gods Law: But I deny not <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> that by theſe Examples it is decent for Princes to grant by Patent or or Charter ſuch Exemption from Tributes; or that Princes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                  <hi>Seſs</hi> 25.</note> Moreover, the ſaid Seſſion was diſpatcht in Poſt-haſt and Precipice (if I may take up the Diaries own word) when the French Prelates were departed from the Councell, and the Spaniſh for their part had put in Proteſtation, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were precipitated, and hudled, and ſhuffled and cut by the nimble fingers of cunning Gameſters: The Acts of the ſaid Councell are not in theſe daies to be cited with like integrity to thoſe of the ancient Councels; which foule Defect, by the godly-wiſe and learned, is juſtly attributed to the diſgrace and diſaſter of our times: And for this reaſon I am perſwaded, the holy Fathers in that Councell aſſembled ſubjoyned the fore-ſaid words; That in caſe any difficulty ſhould grow and ariſe in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times about the Determinations of that Councell, the Pope might have full power to procure and worke ſufficient redreſſe and remedy thereof; either by convocating the learned of thoſe

            <p>But now Sir, that before <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> there was no priviledge of Exemption in the Church; that is I would have you know is apparently untrue; For the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> who raigned more then 200. yeares before <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> and was the firſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour that cleerely made profeſſion of Chriſtianity, preſently declared Eccleſiaſtics to be free from the common burthens of the Common-Wealth; as we read in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> owne Epiſtle to <hi>Avilinus,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Orthodox.</hi> I laſt alledged certaine Examples, which I now perceive have put your learning to ſome plunge: For hitherto your Diſcourſe hath beene onely from Exemption of Tributes; and ſuch Exemption you ſay is taught in Scripture by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Pharoh</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> But whereas you dare to make good proofe and cleere Demonſtration, How Clerics are exempted in Criminall Cauſes, from which they are not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no not by <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> himſelfe in the Novell, I find you puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel'd, perplexed, and (as wee ſay) in more then a peck of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; as appeares by theſe your particular Errours:</p>
            <p n="1">1. You tell me, you have proved in the firſt Propoſition, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was high Prieſt: Surely this I have not denyed; But I have affirmed, that howſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> did withdraw, and retire himſelfe from the exerciſe of the high Prieſt-hood, and ſetled <hi>Aaron</hi> in that high Office, nevertheleſſe he ſtill judged the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites: And this argues he did it as a politicall or Civil Prince, and not as high Prieſt, becauſe if it had appertained to the high Prieſt, no doubt, <hi>Moſes</hi> would have committed that charge to <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was the type of the high Prieſt of the Church, and not <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He that will read the Text ſhall cleerely ſee, that <hi>Solomon</hi> proceeded againſt <hi>Abiathar, Viâ ordinariâ</hi> by the ordinary way, and not by any particular Revelation, and yet as the Miniſter of Gods Juſtice: For every ſecular Prince is <hi>Miniſter Dei in iram ei qui malè agit,</hi> the Miniſter of God to take vengeance on him that doth evill.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:113906:78"/>3. You expound theſe words after your owne fancie and to ſerve your owne turne (<hi>ut impleretur Sermo Domini,</hi> that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled,) as if the Lord had bound <hi>Salomon</hi> by eſpeciall charge and particular precept ſo to thruſt <hi>Abiathar</hi> out of his paſtorall charge: But you muſt not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to dazle mine eyes with any ſuch ſlubbered Expoſition: For the wiſedome of God reacheth from one end to another,<note place="margin">

            <p n="4">4. The Acts of Princes, you ſay, are no Lawes: No more be the Acts of Popes, eſpeciallie of ſuch Popes as have come too ſhort of <hi>Solomons</hi> Wiſedome, when he judged <hi>Abiathar,</hi> which doubtleſſe was before <hi>Solomon</hi> fell into his Apoſtacie or Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But beſides, it ſmels verie ſtronglie of Errour for anie man to affirme (as you ſeeme to doe) that <hi>Solomon</hi> who was endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Spirit, not of Angelicall, but of Divine Wiſedome, and in particular, to give right Judgement of all matters, did ſtumble by erroneous Judgement in <hi>Abiathars</hi> caſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtlie, Whereas I according to the matter, as alſo from antecedent and conſequent examples, doe treate of Exemption from the Court, and of all Eccleſiaſtics; you turne it into the generall: I doe not denie, that <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ſome other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours before <hi>Iuſtinian;</hi> have granted previledges of Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto Eccleſiaſtics, becauſe it appertains unto Princes to grant ſuch priviledges, But I ſpeake of Exemption from Courts and publike Judgements, with a Diſtinction of the ſaid Courts by a Law <hi>In corpore Iuris,</hi> in the bodie of the Law, as hath beene ſhewed in the firſt Propoſition, which was never acted by anie Emperour before <hi>Iuſtinian:</hi> And for this point, having read the Code not in a ſleight or ſuperficiall courſe, I truſt I may affirme without oſtentation, that I cannot be deceived in ſo cleere a matter.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113906:80"/> by foule and forcible intruſion; And even thus hee deales in this Hiſtorie, denying the Authoritie of <hi>Intiprandus</hi> approved in the Church by the ſpace of Dcc. yeares, and other Writers of the ſame times: So that now his Annals not finding ſuch account or conſideration in the World, as no doubt he dreame of and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as alſo for as much as a Booke entituled <hi>Errores Card.

            <p>As for the Addition of <hi>Onuphrius;</hi> firſt I ſay, hee is very moderne, and in a manner new, then I anſwer, that in the ſaid Addition there is nothing that makes againſt my Poſition, but rather on my ſide, and is written in favour of our Tenent, at leaſt if the Election of <hi>Leo</hi> be admitted to paſſe for a lawfull El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But no more of that, or of your Errours: What ſay you to this Example?

            <p>
               <hi>Hetrodox.</hi> You make mee to mervaile much at your ſtrange acuteneſſe in this Argument: I beſeech you Sir, what hath Exemption of Eccleſiaſtics to doe with nomination of perſons to the Pontificiall See? Are not Eccleſiaſtics in France exempted in theſe daies, becauſe the King now nominates men to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to Benefices, to Eccleſiaſticall promotions when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come void? And whereſoever <hi>Ius Patronatus</hi> is in force, is Exemption there loſt, becauſe there the Patrones have the right of Nomination, when they are for the moſt part Laics? For a time then the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> by the Popes Priviledge had power to nominate ſome to the Papall See, when it became void; The Emperour for all that did not give the Pope any Authority, and leſſe could he take it from the Pope; For, as hath been ſaid, God himſelfe giveth Papall Power to the Perſon once nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or Canonically elected, by which Power the Perſon ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,

            <p>Of the Priviledge granted by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Otho,</hi> I might pronounce the very ſame ſentence, if the ſaid Priviledge had not beene altogether void, vain, and without effect; which is by me ſo affirmed, under ſuppoſition,<note place="margin">In Cap.

            <p>But our moſt Illuſtrious, and no leſſe learned Cardinall <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> gives forth cleere and manifeſt evidences,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>9.</hi> Annal. pag. <hi>323.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Gratianus</hi> was deceived, and that ſuch Priviledge to chuſe the higheſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, was never granted unto any Emperour; And ſo this your whole Argument falls in pieces to the ground, becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent is rotten, and the Antecedent falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Of the Lord Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> it hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken plaine enough before, that in the caſe of Immunities his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie lacks weight; I have likewiſe heard it avouched, that as untill this time he hath given himſelfe an ample priviledge and liberty to correct Fathers, Canons, and Hiſtori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Nomination to the Popedome (you ſay) is even as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to Benefices; That Sir, with your good l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>St. <hi>Thomas</hi> denies not Exemption to be grounded upon Gods Law, howſoever he affirmes it ſtands upon the ſtrong Pillars of mans Law; For it may be fixed, nay it is fixed upon the Baſes both of Divine and Humane Law, as the Sacred Canons have not onelie teſtified, but alſo juſtified.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Sotus:</hi> Albeit he denies Exemption to be warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrictly by Gods Law, yet he affirmes it is agreeable to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reaſon, yea he ſubjoines, that no Prince, nor all Princes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, can derogate from the ſaid Exemption: So that directly and cleerly the Doctrine of <hi>Sotus</hi> is contrarie to the preſent and moderne practiſe of the Venetian State, which dareth ſo manie waies violate the ſaid immunitie, as if it reſted in their power to make ſuch Derogation when they pleaſe: Beſides, that <hi>Sotus</hi> did write ſince the Councell of <hi>Trent;</hi> it is nothing ſo: For howſoever he was preſent in the firſt Seſſions then celebrated under <hi>Paulus</hi> III. yet he died before the Councell ended; and

            <p n="7">7. <hi>Sotus</hi> (you ſay with a nice diſtinction) did not write after the Councell, but in the midd time of the Councell; my meaning is, that <hi>Sotus</hi> was perſonally preſent in the Councell, and his Booke was printed after the Councell, ſo did <hi>Conarruuias, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi> and others write after the time of the Councell, and yet were never prohibited by any Authority, as writing any thing contrarie to the Councell, which makes mee to collect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in affirming the ſaid Councell hath determined Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption to be grounded on Gods Law, you are cleane out of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113906:84"/> truth; For had the Councell made any full Determination to your ſaid purpoſe, without all queſtion the foreſaid Authors had beene prohibited by Authoritie.</p>
            <p>But I muſt now tell you plainly <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> they ſhew verie good and great Cards for their game, I mean, their Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not fectleſſe, but full of efficacie: For beſides the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative authority of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> beſides the common uſe and cuſtome of the Primitive Church, they produce likewiſe two negative Arguments moſt effectuall: The firſt, If Clerics themſelves, and the Goods of Eccleſiaſtics be exempted by Gods Law, where is that Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and read? In what Goſpell? in what Apoſtolicall Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle? in what Booke of the New Teſtament, or of the old? The Second, That no Secular Prince Chriſtian carrying a watchfull eye to the tranquillity and honourable government of the State, doth ſtand upon this point, but onely permits Eccleſiaſtics to enjoy ſuch Exemption as to himſelfe ſeemes beſt, and ſuch as he diſlikes, he will not ſuffer them to reape any fruit or benefit from the ſame; And howſoever by the Law of man, ſome underſtand the Canon, yet by ſo much as may be gathered from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the firſt Propoſition, we are to underſtand the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Princes, and the Cuſtome diſſembled by the ſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the Canon received, which Canon cannot be above Gods Law, ſo that if Secular Princes have lawfull power over their Subjects by Gods Law, I cannot ſee how this their Power can be diminiſhed or taken away by the Canon, which is but a Law of man; it is a common rule of the Legiſts, <hi>Quotieſcu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now to your firſt negative Argument; This point hath beene diſcuſſed at large by many Catholique Authors, both Divines and Canoniſts; The grounds of their opinion are to be ſought in their writings; and my ſelfe have briefly before pointed to certaine paſſages, as well of the old Teſtament, as of the New; and this for one, <hi>Ergo liberi ſunt filii,</hi> therefore

               </gap> ſhould exerciſe any power over the ſaid perſons or things: And that this point is a light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is eaſie to be knowne, becauſe in all Religion,<note place="margin">Exod. <hi>30.</hi> Numb. <hi>1.</hi> Gen. <hi>47.</hi> Ariſt. l. <hi>2.</hi> Caeſar. l. <hi>6.</hi> de bello Gall.

            <p>To the ſecond Negative Argument I returne this Anſwer: We find it not in <hi>Sotus</hi> nor yet in <hi>Conarruuias;</hi> It is doubtleſſe a Fiction of your owne braine, and beſides it is no Argument, no Reaſon, but a meere Cavill and Calumniation invented againſt all Princes, as if all Princes were Machiavials Diſciples, and granted or tooke away Exemption from Clerics, as they find it profitable or unprofitable to Reaſon of State; But wee know that in the Church of God there be many Religious and pious Princes, who feare God as they ought: But in caſe it were ſo in truth (which muſt not be granted) that many Princes give neither place nor way to Exemption any further then it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to Reaſon of State, what art, what skill of Reaſoning ſhall I call this? Many Princes permit not Exemption; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Exemption is not by Gods Law? As much in effect for forme of Argument, great skuls, whole troopes of Chriſtians give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to robbing by the high-way ſide, or to luxurious unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in darke corners, or to beare falſe witneſſe in open Courts; <hi>Ergo,</hi> theſe Precepts of the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:113906:85"/> thou ſhalt not commit Adulterie, thou ſhalt not beare falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are not by Gods Law. It ſhould have beene proved that ſuch Princes as permit not Exemption otherwiſe then to their own liking, doe well, or doe not ill; and then the Conſequent would not have come in amiſſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Exemption is not by Gods Law; But from the ſimple Fact, or to ſay better, from the ſimple prevarication of a Law it cannot be concluded, that the ſaid Law is contrary to Gods Law.</p>
            <p>Your next diſcourſe after, about mans Law, as whether it be Canon Law, or Priviledge of Princes, or Cuſtome, is idle and altogether in vaine; for beſides that Exemption of Eccleſiaſtics is by Gods Law, it is every way by mans Law; becauſe there be many Canons, many Civill Lawes, and a muſt long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cuſtome, which make all for this Exemption; This neither will nor can be denyed of any, but ſuch as are of no reading at all.</p>
            <p>Finally, that concluſion which you make of Secular Princes power over Eccleſiaſtics, that it can be neither taken away nor diminiſhed by any Canon, becauſe the Canon is by Mans Law, and the power of Princes by Gods Law, is a falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, drawne from a falſe Principle, and repugnant unto all Catholique Doctors, as well Divines as Canoniſts: Falſe, becauſe it is contrary to many Decrees of Councels, Popes, the Lawes Imperiall, and the light of Nature: Drawne from a falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, becauſe the power of Princes over Laics is not grounded upon Gods Word: Againſt all Catholique Doctors, as well Divines as Canoniſts, becauſe both <hi>Sotus</hi> and <hi>Conarruuias,</hi> comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the chiefe Pillars of thoſe who maintaine that Exemption is not warrantable to Eccleſiaſtics by Gods Law, have not ſtucke to teſtifie by their learned pens, that Popes have plenary power to exempt Eccleſiaſtics, that all Princes are bound to uphold and maintaine the Popes Exemption, as alſo that no Prince, (no not all Princes together) hath one dram of power to annihilate or diſanull, or in the leaſt meaſure to diminiſh the ſaid Papall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption.</p>
            <p>Thus much is affirmed and witneſſed by <hi>Sotus</hi> and <hi>Conarru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uias,</hi> in the very ſame paſſeges by your ſelfe <hi>Orthodox</hi> produced and alleadged: It hereupon followes, that you have now broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113906:85"/> a new, an erroneous, a ſcandalous, a ſchiſmaticall and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Doctrine: If this notwithſtanding, you ſhall affirme it is no new Doctrine, you ſhall be ſure to find none other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Fautors, and followers of this Doctrine, but Heretiques, and in particular <hi>Martyr</hi> a Lutheran upon the 13. chapter of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Orthodox.</hi> I have made no long Repetition, but onely a ſhort remembrance of ſome former ſpeeches; what need ſuch a hot reprehenſion for putting you only in mind what I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Now then Sir your Errors.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In defence of your opinion <hi>de Iure divino,</hi> you find no place of Scripture to warrant your aſſertion; whereupon you fall into this new and ſtrange Doctrine, that Exemption holds by the Law of Nations, and that Law of Nations is Law Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or the Law of God: No marvaile, for I ſuppoſe you have ſpoken this (to pleaſe your ſelfe and flatter others) againſt one who of late hath written according to the Doctrine of the beſt Authors; In ſuch a mind how could you doe leſſe then fall into ſuch a Noveltie?</p>

               </gap>one that can diſpoſe of his owne at his owne pleaſure; Hee can give, ſell, lay to gage or pawne, and make it over when, how, and to whom he lift or thinkes good: And a naturall Signor or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rd is one, that hath Dominion by Heriſon, by Succeſſion of bloud, by Birth-right, not by Election or Donation: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be convenient for the Duke of Venice to be the Naturall Signor of the Venetian State, I referre my ſelfe upon the matter to the judgement of everie man, or of anie one, that knowes the ſtate and affaires of that noble and illuſtrious Republic.</p>
            <p>You ſay moreover, the Prince of Venice knowes no Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in Temporals, but God alone: Doe not you hereby make him a Lord no leſſe abſolute, then Supream and Soveraigne Kings, to whom the Common-wealth hath paſt over all her power? But if the Republic be a true Republic, and free indeed as it pretends, doubtleſſe it hath not paſt over and transferred all her power to the Prince, but hath onely communicated and conferred upon him ſuch part of her power, as to herſelfe ſeemeth good: Shee can augment or make little enough, or take it away altogether; She can make the Prince ſhorter by the head, whenſoever hee ſhall attempt to practiſe or make himſelfe the Head, Lord, and Patron of the Republic, which was her practiſe of Juſtice and Power upon the perſon of <hi>Marinus Fallerius;</hi> And ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:113906:89"/> the Duke ought to know for his Superior, not God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but likewiſe his Republic, or the Grand Counſell: But paſſe we from theſe Errours; For if they doe not pinch the Venetians, they need the leſſe to pinch ſtrangers; Let us then come to the point and knot of the controverſie.</p>
            <p>Both your Author and your ſelfe <hi>Orthodox</hi> affirme, the Duke of Venice hath not ſinned in making Lawes prejudiciall to the Church, and in committing Eccleſiaſtics to priſon, for which Acts he hath been reproved by the Pope, and after that in defect of his obedience, hath beene cenſured with Excommunication: That he hath not ſinned, you prove by three reaſons: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Duke hath power immediatly from God over the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Goods of Eccleſiaſtics; Secondly, becauſe the Pope was never deſpoiled of the ſaid power, neither by Priviledges granted, nor by Canons received and admitted: Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Duke hath ſtill held poſſeſſion (and yet holds the ſame to this day) time out of mind: Your firſt reaſon is falſe by your owne affirmation in your laſt Speech, and by evident experience: For you affirme in your laſt paſſage, that the Duke of Veni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e hath power to puniſh Eccleſiaſtics in grievous and atrocious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts or crimes; your owne affirmation therein is a manifeſt ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that his power is not immediately from God derived, but from ſome other, by whom the ſaid power was granted with ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation; For if the Duke had power over Eccleſiaſtics imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Gods Law, then he ſhould have it in all caſes, both grievous and light, both atrocious and not atrocious: Likewiſe you affirme, the Duke hath power to diſpoſe of all Goods, not yet made over and transferred to Eccleſiaſtics: What can you meane by this Limitation, but onely that hee hath not abſolute power over Eccleſiaſtic Goods, and ſo hath it not immediately from God? For were it ſo, he might not be limited by anie other, as the Popes power is not limitable, becauſe his power is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatelie from God: Beſides, I demand whether the Republic hath power to diminiſh and encreaſe the Dukes Authoritie, and whether it can depoſe him from his Magiſtracie, when he beares not himſelfe therein according to the Venetian Lawes? Out of all queſtion the Republic hath power ſo to doe: The Duke then hath not his power immediatelie from God, but from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:113906:89"/> and ſo the Dukes power is an Humane power, limited, and ſubject unto a higher Power, which is alſo Humane.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond reaſon ſtands in like degree of untruth: For if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>y hold true, becauſe he never can be deſpoiled, who never was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Your third reaſon drawne from poſſeſſion time out of mind, is refuted by the words of the Venetian Lords themſelves; For they in <hi>Anno</hi> 1605. renewed a Law, enacted in <hi>Anno</hi> 1536.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:113906:92"/> for them to look unto the Root whereon it growes; whether it be grounded on the Scripture, on the Fathers, on the Priviledge of Princes, or on uſe and Cuſtome, and to remember the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes and priviledges of Countries, are much different: And finally, ſeeing the proper end of the Venetian Lords is excellent good, not only not contrary to life eternall, but rather confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable thereunto, for the better maintaining of a Chriſtian and Catholique Republic in her entire ſtrength and power, as alſo for the better execution of Juſtice, and for the better brideling of Clerics, when they know the Lawes have provided for the mature and ſevere puniſhment of their Civill Delicts, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Actions and Lawes of the ſaid Venetian Lords with ſilence: For even the very ſame Authors, who give the Pope Authority to intrude himſelfe ſometimes indirectly in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, do give him the ſaid Authority in caſe of extreame neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when the people are ſtopped in the right courſe to life eternall; Now, for ſo much as the Actions and Lawes of the Venetian Lords are not only no hinderance to their Subjects in the courſe to eternall life, but rather make the way more facile, and bring the ſame as it were to a ſhorter cut, what neceſſity can his Holineſſe have, whereby he ſhould be moved to reſtrain thoſe publike Lawes, which are out of his owne Element, and not under the Lee of his Juriſdiction?</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is your manner, and a ſlie trick of your cunning to make ſhew, that you do not ſee the force of our Argument, we draw not our Argument from that power which the Prince hath from God in the generall: but from that power the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exerciſe whereof the Prince never loſt, neither by Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge granted, nor by Canon received, nor by long Cuſtome; which is a Law to prove, that his Acts done conformeable to his power are good and lawfull: Now you <hi>Hetrodox</hi> from theſe particular Acts of the Pr nce, would prove the Prince hath none other power from God at all; The Prince hath power from God over all Temporall matters, but his power is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in ſome, and not in other; becauſe he hath exempted ſome from his power by Priviledge, and not ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Now this doth imply or ſignifie, that his power is not granted from God with a certaine limitation, as you contend,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113906:92"/> but rather that he himſelfe limits his own power by his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges granted; For the Temporall Princes power in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, no arme of fleſh can limit, provided it be not a Tyrannicall power, (neither hath it any Superiour but God alone) much leſſe when it is exerciſed <hi>ad optimum finem</hi> to the beſt end.</p>
            <p n="8">8. You make us to affirme, the Duke hath power to puniſh, power to diſpoſe, power to make Lawes, we neither take up the word Duke, nor the word power for this matter, we only ſpeake of the Prince, that is, of the Republic, that he, the Prince, or ſhe, the Republic, doth puniſh, doth diſpoſe, doth make Lawes, there is great difference, you know, between Act &amp; Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, betweene power to enact Lawes and enacting of Lawes.</p>

You affirme, the Republic taking his beginning, when Eccleſiaſtics were exempted before, ſhe could not be diveſted of that wherein ſhe was never inveſted: In this point <hi>Hetrodox</hi> you ſhould have drawn ſome plain Demonſtration, that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics were exempted in thoſe times of the Republics birth; Whereas you alledge but one priviledge of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. not worth whiſtling, but a new upſtart inſtance in a manner of two daies old, and ſuch as with Eccleſiaſtics doth not deſerve to beare any ſway: For after the ſaid Priviledge he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and depoſed from the Empire by <hi>Gregorie</hi> IX. and ſo by conſequence all his Conſtitutions were annulled: But Sir, the Lords of Venice have run ſtill at all times by the File, and have cut their cloth by the thred of the moſt holy Emperor <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> whoſe Novell was de-cryed, like falſe and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Coyne, and never ſpoiled Eccleſiaſtics of any Exemption
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:113906:93"/> which they formerly enjoyed, but rather endowed them with other new Priviledges.</p>
            <p n="12">12. You affirme againe, that <hi>vi characteris,</hi> by vertue of the Character due to the order of Prieſts, the Prince is deprived of his Authority over his owne Subjects; Touching which point I anſwer thus much, and ſay no more; If the Character of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme hath no vertue,<note place="margin">Quaeſt <hi>15.</hi> de Reſtitu Cap Novit de judiciu.

            <p n="13">13. You pretend that Scripture, the Law of God, Canons and Councels have granted Exemption unto Eccleſiaſtics: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is not commanded in Divine Scripture, nor taught in the Law of Nature, which is likewiſe Divine; No ſuch matter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Councels, nor by the Canons <hi>tanquam de Fide,</hi> as before hath been declared: As touching ſome other Canons of Exemption made by Popes, I acknowledge that (where they have been lawfully publiſhed and received) in thoſe Kingdomes, Countries, and States, they ſtand yet in their full force, and that (except in caſe of extreame neceſſity, to ſpeak in the termes of <hi>Sotus</hi> and <hi>Conarruuias</hi>) by any ordinary means, or for any ordinary cauſe, they are not ſufferable of Derogation, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto lyable, as hath beene defined in matter of Priviledges; But Sir, this makes nothing to the purpoſe of our preſent caſe touching the Venetian Lords, who never yet received any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which was contrary to Lawes of their own making in theſe preſent daies and times.</p>
            <p n="14">14. You produce the Canon <hi>Si quis ſuadente, &amp;c.</hi> If any tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Devils inſtigation ſhall offer violence, and lay violent hands on a Cleric, and here you preſuppoſe (without either grant or thankes for your paines) the Venetian Lords by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicall perſwaſion have with violent hands attempted and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the perſons of Clerics: But you muſt be anſwered with a godly reſolution to your Diabolicall preſuppoſition. The ſaid Lords have not done any ſuch Execution by the ſuggeſtion of Satan, but by the perſwaſion of God, and of honourable Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; As for your famous Canon, that ſpeakes of private
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:113906:93"/> wrongs and offences: Otherwiſe the Eccleſiaſticall Judges themſelves in like manner ſhould be fetcht within the power and penalty thereof: So that in the Venetian Territorie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is duly obſerved; For in caſe a private perſon by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils inſtigation ſhall caſt violent hands on a Cleric, and thereby tumble into the ſtrong Net or Toyle of Excommunication, his Abſolution is procured.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Republic (you ſay) is not in the poſſeſſion of the Judicature that ſhe exerciſeth, or of the Lawes that ſhe cauſeth to paſſe in public; The moſt learned Father <hi>Paulus</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations hath moſt excellently proved this Aſſertion to be moſt untrue; Two things only will I here annexe; The Law named upon this matter was firſt made in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1333. and not in <hi>Anno</hi> 1536. as you have alleadged: Secondly, the Prince hath Authority to enact Lawes, to renew Lawes, or to dilate Lawes, but not becauſe Lawes are ſometimes not obſerved; For the ſame authority whereby a Law was made at firſt, gives the Prince ſufficient power to renew, to dilate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſaid Law.</p>
            <p n="16">16. You attribute unto the Duke, that which is the Order of the whole Republic; For only the Republic hath ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>ad vim vi repellendam,</hi> to reſiſt force by force, and to provide that by Hereſie the State be not infected: And therefore, both becauſe the Republic ſtands upon a ſure ground of certaine knowledge, that the Popes preſent Cenſures are in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of meer Nullity, (whereof ſhe makes not ſo much as the leaſt doubt) as alſo becauſe it pleads poſſeſſion time out of mind, ſhe juſtly pretends the interdict hath never been obſerved in her Dominion.</p>
            <p n="17">17. It fills not Monaſteries with Souldiers, as you object; That's but an old wifes tale, whoſoever is the Reporter, much more a meer fable, that ſhe exerciſeth public perſecution of the Church: No ſurely; What ſhe doth is done in favour of the Church; If it be not ſo <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> tell us what one Hereſie by name is protected or ſo much as never ſo little countenanced by the Republic, which pretends none other matter, but only to defend and maintain her owne.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Moreover, you have matched the Republic with Arrian

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:113906:95"/> in</hi> 6. there be only three Canons by which the Judiciarie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is determined: In the firſt Chapter the ſentence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be put down <hi>in Scriptis,</hi> in the Chapter, <hi>Solet,</hi> it is commanded, that no man ſhall be Excommunicated, after hee hath appealed: In the Chapter, <hi>Statuimus,</hi> it is commanded, that no man ſhall be excommunicated, except firſt he be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically thereof advertiſed by three Admonitions: And albeit every Defect makes not a ſentence to be no ſentence, yet in the preſent caſe we need not flie unto this excuſe; For the ſentence of our Lord the Pope was given <hi>in Scriptis,</hi> and with all the three Admonitions of eight daies for the firſt Terme, eight for the ſecond, and eight for the third: No Appeale interpoſed, nor could be interpoſed, where the Pope is the Supream Judge; So that with all exactneſſe the Judiciarie Order commanded by the Canons <hi>De Sententia Excommunicationis in</hi> 6. hath beene duely obſerved, it was your part <hi>Orthodox</hi> to produce the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and to demonſtrate in which of theſe three points it hath not been obſerved, but alas you could not as it ſeemes, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſufficient by like to beguile the ignorant, you paſſe it onely in generall termes.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Hetrodox.</hi> From falſe Principles you inferre a falſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That for ſo much as the ſentence of our holy Father is of

            <p>Firſt you affirme, That according to the Doctrine of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varrus,</hi> the Sentence of the Pope, when it is <hi>Nulla,</hi> is to be feared and obſerved, untill the people ſhall be thorowly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Nullitie, to the end there may breed and grow no ſcandall; Then you ſubjoyne, the Venetian people are fully and wholly perſwaded of the Nullity of the Popes Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the Dukes Edict, as much to ſay, when the Judge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes his Sentence is juſt and in full force, and the Malefactor ſales it is unjuſt and of no force, when the Malefactor ſhould be credited, and the Judge not believed: What Sentence at any time ſhall goe current for juſt and in force, if the Malefactors word and credit may be taken?</p>
            <p>Next you affirme, That certaine Religious perſons are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable, for chuſing to depart out of the City, rather then to celebrate Divine Offices; and that very many thereby have beene ſcandalized: Alas good Sir, the ſaid Religious have no need of your excuſe, and if any other have beene ſcandalized by their obedience to the holy Father, the words of our Saviour to the Phariſees will ſerve well to remove and take away the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, <hi>Sinite illo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then you affirme, it is enjoyned by Gods Law to defend the liberty of their Prince; whereas Eccleſiaſticall Sentences are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by mans Law, and that ought ever to give place unto the Law of God: At every word you take the Divine Law in your mouth, no mervaile your Argument runs in this divine forme: To defend the Princes liberty is by the Law of God: Eccleſiaſtical Sentences are by the Law of man, the Law of man gives place unto the Law of God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Prieſts ought to deſpiſe the Popes Excommunication and Interdict, and to defend the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Venetian Duke: But heare you Sir my anſwer; If it be by Gods Law to defend the Liberty of an Earthly Prince, much more it is by Gods Law to defend the liberty of the Church, the Spouſe of the Heavenlie Prince.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:113906:100"/>
            <p>I ſay moreover; The liberty which the Duke of Venice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends now a daies, is a liberty to clap up ſuch in priſon as are none of his Subjects, and to make Lawes againſt Juſtice and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore it is according to Gods Law, not to defend, but rather to impugne ſuch a Liberty: And I yet ſubjoyn, that Eccleſiaſticall Sentences (as touching Power) are by Gods Law eſtabliſhed,<note place="margin">

            <p>And againe you affirme, That ſome are deceived in thinking this preſent controverſie to be <hi>de Fide,</hi> when it is onely <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> and that if any thing be expreſſed in Scripture which makes this buſineſſe to be <hi>de Fide,</hi> it is the Republics opinion, expreſſely taught by St. <hi>Paul:</hi> I anſwer; The Principall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is not <hi>de Fide;</hi> Nevertheleſſe, thoſe who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the defence of the Venetian Cauſe, have in their diſcourſes mingled certain Errors in matter of Faith: And whereas in your accuſtomed way, of Wiſedome, no doubt, you tell us the opinion of the Signorie is expreſly taught by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> your wiſedome doth not marke, That ſuch things as are expreſſely taught by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> cannot be called opinions; For then it ſhould follow, that ſome doubt might be made of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, becauſe opinions are ever doubtfull and uncertaine; The truth is <hi>Hetro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> the opinion of the Signorie is not found in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrewes: Obey them that have the overſight of you,<note place="margin">

            <p>Moreover, you affirme that Prieſts ought not in any wiſe to make a rent or ſeparation from their Head the Prince; What can a Proteſtant Heretique of England ſay more? Who ever heard, that a Secular Prince is the Head of Prieſts, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Head of the Church, but ſince <hi>Henrie</hi> VIII. turned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell to the Pope, and cauſed himſelfe to be ſtiled Head of the Engliſh Church? for all this you <hi>Orthodox</hi> dare tell us, that in theſe Treatiſes there is handled no matter of Faith, but onely of Manners.</p>

            <p>Beſides, you highly extoll the Eccleſiaſtics of Venice, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt ready to lay downe their life for their Prince: Surely they muſt needs be a new and ſtrange kind of Saints, that are ſo willing to ſpend their life in the cauſe and quarrell of a Prince, by whom they are compelled to commit Sacriledge, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Vicar of Chriſt; The Saints, till now, have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Lyturgie, to be <hi>Triumphatores, qui contemnentes juſſa Principum mernorunt praemia aeterna,</hi> to be valiant and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Champions, who contemning the Precepts of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes, have merited Eternall rewards: From henceforth by like, the Hymne ſhall have need to be altered, that we may ſing, <hi>Iſti ſunt Triumphatores, qui contempſerunt Deum, ut ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varent juſta Principum,</hi> Theſe are the valiant and Tryumphant Champions, who have contemned God, to keepe and obſerve the Precepts of Princes; at leaſt if wee ſhall believe theſe new Doctors.</p>
            <p>Againe, The Lords of Venice (you affirme) have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Religions upon paine of death to keepe their Churches upon, and to celebrate all Divine Offices, that vain feare might not cauſe nor bring them to be intermitted in that City, moſt Catholique in all former Ages, and now profeſſing to continue Catholique more then at any time heretofore: You ſhall receive no anſwer to this point from the lips of <hi>Hetrodox,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt ſhall give the Anſwer by the mouth of <hi>Samuel:</hi>

            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:113906:101"/>
            <p>Againe, you puts us in mind to peruſe the Doctrine of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varrus,</hi> and are bold to affirme, That <hi>Navarrus</hi> makes for your ſide in all that before hath beene declared: At laſt, you fall upon a courſe of exhortation, that all men would retire themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecure port of this Doctrine, that ſuch Exemption as all Eccleſiaſtics now enjoy, are not enjoyed by Gods Law, but by Priviledge of Secular Princes, in whom there is full power to retract, diminiſh, dilate, and amplifie the ſaid priviledges at their pleaſure: I anſwer; Herein <hi>Orthodox</hi> doth unjuſtly defame, and undiſcreetlie blemiſh the reputation of <hi>Navarrus,</hi> as one that favours and bolſters <hi>Orthodox</hi> in ſo many Errors as <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> hitherto hath taught and uttered in this Defence: But for ſo much as <hi>Navarrus</hi> his workes are extant in print, and read of all men, I referre my ſelfe to the Readers judgement: But Sir, that Secular Princes by any power of their owne, may retract or diminiſh the Priviledges of Exemption granted to Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall perſons; that's a Doctrine ſo falſe and ſo new, that by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narruuias</hi> himſelfe, an Author of all other leaſt favourable to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Exemption, it is <hi>in Specie</hi> reproved and condemned; Thus have I fully ſatisfied, if I be not greatly deceived, all your Objections in your owne conceit, worthy to be highly prized, and had in great Eſtimation, if not Admiration.</p>
            <p>Now comes my turne to adviſe, to exhort, and to beſeech (as with my beſt heart I doe) the moſt noble Republic, and her moſt excellent Prince, deeply to weigh and conſider in their moſt grave and incomparable wiſedome in what Doctors and Teachers they repoſe their truſt:<note place="margin">In Summa. cap. <hi>25.</hi> nu. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> What? Is <hi>Navarrus</hi> wholly on their ſide, when he pronounceth it is a ſin, to conſtraine or command Eccleſiaſtics not to keepe and obſerve the Interdict?

So that according to the Doctrine of <hi>Navarrus,</hi> the Prince that caſts either Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics or Monkes in priſon, or preſumes in a Criminall cauſe to judge either of both, ſinneth againſt Gods Law, he ſinneth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe againſt Gods Law, when he commands Clerics or Monks
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:113906:101"/> to ſay Maſſe or Divine Service, becauſe theſe things are Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and laſtly he ſinneth againſt Gods Law, if he attempt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null, or to diminiſh Exemption granted to Clerics or Monkes by Almightie God: Thus the Lords of Venice may ſee, how falſly they have been inſtructed by ſome of their owne Doctors, and how under the name of <hi>Navarrus</hi> they have been deceived: The ſame fraud and impoſture hath been put as a trick of cunning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid Lords by all ſuch as to this day have given themſelves the reines of libertie to put in print certain Librets or ſmall Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets of like matter and ſtuffe, but all farced and ſtuffed with Novelties and lies; Againe I exhort and beſeech all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtics to thinke that none can beare more ardent, ſincere, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent affection to the Child, then the naturall Parents, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mother, that howſoever they have (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) many Paedagogues, Teachers, or Schoole-maſters, yet but one Father: Their Mother is the holie Romane Church, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the High Prieſt or chiefe Biſhop, by whom (in Chriſts place) they have had their Nurſing and Education, untill they are now grown great, and capable of the Inheritance of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Paradiſe; They are therefore to preſuppoſe this Mother, and this Father wiſh and worke for their building up in Faith, in Truth, in all wholeſome Doctrine, much more then theſe Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, who teach them Rules and Leſſons backwards, by that order commonly called <hi>Arſie-varſie;</hi> Laſt of all, I exhort and beſeech, not onely the ſaid Lords, but all Eccleſiaſtics in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Government and Territorie, well to conſider and thinke upon Gods Judgements, which many times he brings the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſtouteſt Princes to feele even in this life.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> VII. for the ſins of King <hi>Boneſlaus</hi> interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the whole Kingdome of <hi>Polonia,</hi> excommunicated the King, and deprived him of the Regall Title; The King perſiſted indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and impenitent; God puniſhed the King; firſt by making him underpriſed or deſpiſed by his owne Subjects and abhorred by ſtrangers: This potion wrought not upon the King: God ſent a ſecond ſcourge, by raiſing Rebellion in ſome part of the Kingdome, with great diſſentions and ſeditions in the reſt; This Medicine alſo tooke no effect; God ſent a third ſcourge, made the King runne as it were out of his wits, wander tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

His own horſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time fell upon his body by mishap and at unawares, and ſo he ſuddenly dyed, without anie time to be abſolved of his ſins, and from the ſaid Cenſures; The ſame God is now that was then, and of the ſame Omnipotencie which then he had: So that if Almightie God hath ſo ſeverely and rigorouſlie puniſhed thoſe, who forced not others to deſpiſe the Diſcipline and Cenſures of the Church, but onely have themſelves in their owne perſons deſpiſed the power and Authoritie of the Keyes; What mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, if in theſe times preſent he ſhall puniſh thoſe, who not onely themſelves deſpiſe the ſaid Cenſures, but likewiſe by threatning of death, compell and inforce their Subjects to deſpiſe the ſame; Let us therefore be obedient to the voice of the Holie Ghoſt in the Pſalmes:<note place="margin">Pſal.

Whether a Sentence be unjuſt and in ſtate of meere Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or no, credit (you ſay) ſhould not be given to the Delinquent or Malefactor, but rather to the Judge: I have not affirmed that either the one or the other ſhould be credited; For both may be intereſſed and blinded with paſſion: But I onely affirme, That he ſhould be credited, who diſcovers and manifeſts the truth of his Aſſertions by certaine and evident reaſons; And in ſo doing he doth not ſin or offend, becauſe he doth not anie thing unlawfull or unpermitted: Neither can anie power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever controule or curbe his judgement, and reſtraine his free opinion, from affirming a thing to be certaine, whenſoever by the certainty and evidence of ſtrong reaſons he is induced to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and hold the ſaid opinion, nor the judgement or free opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe, to whom the ſaid certainty and evidence is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, from affirming and holding the ſame opinion; I ſay more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that howſoever thoſe upon whom any unjuſt Sentence is executed with force and violence, cannot ſhun or avoid the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, nevertheleſſe they may in publike declare their griefe and ſorrow for ſuch injuſtice, and yet ſhall remaine quit from anie merit of blame: No more are thoſe to be blamed, who lay open to the whole world the Nullity and Injuſtice of a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure publiſhed, when it is lawfull for them, not onelie to hold

            <p n="4">4. You grant obedience to the Naturall Prince, and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in his Defence is by Gods Law, and the holy Fathers ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by mans Law; and nevertheleſſe without any reaſon, you denie the conſequence, that Subjects have done well and taken the right courſe in obeying their Prince, rather then the Sentence of the Pope: The inſtance which you induce is of no more force or weight then your firſt Anſwer: For thus you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre; If it be according to Gods Law for Subjects to defend the Liberty of their Naturall Prince on Earth, much more it is according to Gods Law to defend the liberty of the Church, the Spouſe of the Prince in Heaven: It is a true Inference I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, but nothing pertinent or proper to the preſent caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lords of Venice never pretended to rob the Church of any Right or Libertie whatſoever: For the Lords leaving all things in their entire ſtrength, doe enact moſt juſt Lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary judgements, touching Delicts and Goods which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto their power; This they have alwaies done time out of mind, and yet never anie of this preſent Popes predeceſſors hath taken ſtomack againſt our Lords for ſuch their Acts, but rather by connivance or tacite ſilence hath yeelded gracious conſent to their juſt operations: So that in Venice there being none that goeth about or ſeeks to deprive the Church of anie Libertie, how can the Eccleſiaſtics there have anie occaſion to defend the ſaid Libertie?</p>
            <p n="5">5. You againe confound the word Duke, and the word Prince; The Duke doth not anie thing of him ſelfe in the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian State, the Prince, that is, the Republic ſets downe all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Prince makes all the Lawes: To what purpoſe then ſhould you ſeek to draw the perſon of the Duke into any odious hatred by putting the Duke to be the Author of thoſe Acts,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113906:104"/> which are to be attributed unto the whole Republic, as unto the true Father and Mother of the ſaid Acts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You affirme, the Prince of Venice commits to priſon ſuch as have ho ranke amongſt his owne Subjects; The contrary hath been already proved, that Clerics in grievous Delicts, which touch not ſo much as the hemme of Spirituals, are not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo that by conſequence they are in the ranke of Subjects, as alſo it hath beene ſhewed before, that the liberty left by Chriſt our Lord unto the Church, is the libertie of the Spirit, and from the bondage or ſlaverie of ſinne.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

You put us in mind, that Eccleſiaſticall Sentences, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching power, are by Gods Law; This will not be denyed or gaine-ſaid, ſo long as they marſhall themſelves within their own bounds and territories; but when they fall to range out of their owne Religion or Limits, and to laſh thoſe who juſtly ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the practiſe of their owne Temporall and lawfull power; then they are not onelie by Gods Law in reſpect of their power, but directlie oppoſite unto the Law of God, and flat againſt all reaſon.</p>
            <p n="9">9. You grant and confeſſe the preſent Controverſie ſtands not in point of Faith, but in matter of Manners; Then you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne that, which neither your ſelfe nor anie other hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor ſhall ever by Gods grace be able to prove, that in the Bookes written by ſuch as hold and maintaine the opinion of the Republic, there are to be found ſundrie Errours in Faith: An Error in Faith is, when one affirmes a point of Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie either to ſacred Scripture, or to the definitive judgment of the Church, which cannot erre <hi>tanquam de Fide;</hi> This no man living ſhall be able to prove, hath at anie time been taught by ſuch as have defended, or now doe maintain the cauſe of the Republic: When matters are debated of ſo great importance, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to hang a Prieſt in generals; If the Diſputant ſeeke or think men ſhould give him Faith and Credit, without all heſitation,

            <p n="10">10. You confound the Principles and the Concluſion, which is virtually contained in the Principles: The Principle from which the opinion of the Republic is derived, is touching Faith, and in St. <hi>Paul, Omnis anima, &amp;c.</hi> Let every Soule be ſubject unto the higher Powers; but the Concluſion is a certaine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grounded upon all that hath beene ſaid before: I have not ſaid, the Principle taught by St. <hi>Paul</hi> is an opinion, but have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that opinion is moſt certain, which is grounded upon a Principle of Faith, taught by the Divine Apoſtle; And ſo the ſharpe ſubtiltie, or ſubtle ſharpneſſe of this your oppoſition vaniſheth like ſmoake in the vaſt Region of the Aire.</p>

            <p n="12">12. I never ſpeake of the Head in Spirituals, who is the Pope, but of the Head in Temporals, who is the Prince; to whom the Subjects are obliged by more then manie Titles and Tyes: Let men read over the 23. Homilie of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Romanes: But Proteſtants tell another tale, and ſing in another Keye; Namely, that a Prince Temporall is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Head in Spirituals, but I for my part dare not go ſo farre: The end of any operation (which makes the operation good and laudable) is over the principall, not ſecondary and conſequent, according to the common Doctrine of Divines: For Example;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:113906:105"/> Our Lord Chriſt deſired to dye, and voluntarilie expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to death, even the death of the Croſſe; This death could not follow, if <hi>Judas, Pilate,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees had not ſinned; This notwithſtanding, no man muſt or dare affirme, their ſin was the end of Chriſts death or ſuffering, and that his worke of immenſe love did merit anie blame at all, for and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their wicked and ſinfull action: For to determine the goodneſſe and juſtice of an Operation, then reckoning muſt not be drawn from the ſecondarie, but onelie from the Primarie and Principall end: In like manner ſay I, the Subjects end is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme obedience unto his Temporall Prince in thoſe things which may juſtlie and lawfullie be commanded by the Prince; The Subject cannot performe ſuch duties enjoyned by his Prince, without renouncing his obedience to the Popes invalide and void Sentences: In this caſe it muſt not be ſaid, the Subjects Action is to deſpiſe the Pope, or to contemne his Papall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; For the Subjects end is to obey him, whom he is bound to obey, and by whom he is lawfully commanded; his end is not in anie wiſe to deſpiſe the Holie Father, and his Cenſures, which nevertheleſſe upon a neceſſarie conſequence he doth not obſerve, as one preferring the Superiour and Primarie end before the Inferior and Conſequent.</p>
            <p n="13">13. I have not affirmed, that Subjects laying down their life in obedience and for the defence of their Naturall and lawfull Prince, are holy Martyrs, but onelie that in ſo doing, they doe not ill, but rather well; neither can it be ſaid of ſuch good and faithfull Subjects, Theſe are the noble and tryumphant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, who have contemned God to keepe the commands of Princes, but rather, Theſe are the victorious and tryumphant Conquerors, who to keepe Gods commandements have obeyed their Princes.</p>
            <p n="14">14. You confound the name of God with the name of Man; <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpeakes of Gods name,<note place="margin">

            <p n="15">15. You call that Doctrine of Diminiſhing and Ampllating of Priviledges a falſe and new Doctrine: It is nothing ſo; you know that Popes every day doe the like, by their Spirituall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: What ſhall then let a Temporall Prince to doe the ſame by his Temporall power? <hi>Conarruuias</hi> and <hi>Sotus</hi> are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with the word <hi>Ordinarilie,</hi> and <hi>out of the caſe of neceſſitie;</hi> For in caſe of neceſſitie, for Example, <hi>To rebutte and repell force;</hi> (for ſo ſpeaketh <hi>Sotus</hi>) or in other caſes of neceſſity (and ſo ſpeake all thoſe who treat of Priviledges) my Doctrine and Aſſertion is uncontrouleable and undeniable, moſt ancient as well for the Right, as for the Fact.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Navarrus</hi> frames this Argument, <hi>Plus differt Chriſtianus à Pagano, quam Clericus à Chriſtiano;</hi> There is a greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Chriſtian and a Pagan, then is between a Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric

            <p>Now the Venetian Prince having commanded an Action of vertue; namely, the non-obſerving of a non-interdict <hi>quod ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebat in periculum Divini cultus &amp; Religionis,</hi> which tended to the manifeſt hazzard and danger of Gods Worſhip and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Surely, they have not ſinned, but have obſerved the Doctrine of <hi>Navarrus</hi> to a haire.</p>
            <p n="18">18. None of us deny the Pope, or chiefe Biſhop, to be the Vicar of our Father in Heaven for Spirituall Cauſes: but wee ſay moreover, The Prince is the Father of the People in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Cauſes; and withall, That as the Son hath reaſon to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Father, who ſeekes to deprive him of his own particular goods and portions, to him appropiated, either by reaſon of Dowry, or otherwiſe. Even ſo the Prince ought not to obey the Biſhop, (howſoever, he goes for the Princes Father in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als) when the Biſhop pretends to deprive him of his Temporall Goods and Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p n="19">19.

            <p n="21">21. The example of King <hi>Boneſlaus</hi> is nothing apt, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the caſe; King <hi>Boneſlaus</hi> was an impious and moſt wicked perſon, infamous and notorious for many fowle crimes: The Republic is a <hi>Pack</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) or an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and uniform knot of pious and Catholic Senators, great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Juſtice, and renowned Zelators of Religion.</p>

               <hi>Theſis,</hi> three in <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> the ſame Doctrine is manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be found, Catholic, and tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, conformable to divine and holy Scripture, to generall Councels, to ſacred Canons, to imperiall Conſtitutions, to the example of holy Popes, of moſt prudent Kings and Emperours, to the Doctrine of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I and of thoſe Catholic Doctors, who have written and printed ſince the ſacred Councell of Trent, by name <hi>Navarrus, Medina, Couarruvias, Victoria, Sotus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cornelius, Janſenius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all thoſe three Propoſitions, which make up the main of the controverſie, are moſt certain and true, Catholic and moſt firmely founded, as extracted from the ſweet Fountain of holy Scripture, from the goodly great Rivers of Generall Councels; of ſacred Canons, of Imperiall Conſtitutions, of unreproveable Hiſtories, of worthy Saints, and of Catholic Doctors. The three Propoſitions be theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The chiefe Biſhop, <hi>Nudus a Donariis &amp; Privilegiis Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipum, &amp; jure Pontificatus,</hi> as <hi>Navarrus</hi> writeth, and St. <hi>Barnard;</hi> that is to ſay, ſtript and left naked of Princes, Donations, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and only meaſured by the right Pole of his Pontificall Prieſt-hood, or high Prieſtly Dignity, <hi>nullam habet laicam Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem,</hi> can claime or challenge no kind of Laic-power, neither in the higheſt degree, nor in the middleward, nor in the loweſt ranke, <hi>ne<expan>

            <p n="2">2. In temporall matters, and in other Delicts Temporall, <hi>quae Spiritualia non attinent,</hi> having nothing to doe with Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als (for that phraſe is uſed by <hi>Couarruvias</hi>) Eccleſiaſtics are not exempted from the ſecular Prince his power, in the whole, or for the whole, and by the Law of God, but only for ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts, and in ſome caſes, or matters, and that either by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Princes themſelves, or by Pontificial Canon, which the ſaid Princes have received and admitted, or elſe by cuſtome long approved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That a void and invalide Sentence, when there is a cleere <hi>Conſtat</hi> of the Nullity, ought neither to be obſerved, nor ſo much as feared; So that of all the former Doctrine in this whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that may be averred of the Venetian Republic, which the Holy Ghoſt hath ſpoken of the white Dove in the Canticles, <hi>Et macula non eſt in te,</hi> and thou art without ſpot; moſt of all in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113906:108"/> thoſe her two wings, I mean in the defence of her Catholic Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of her liberty; which two Prerogatives proper to her ſelf, and to this day pure Virgins, we hope and truſt ſo much in the favour of our Lord God, that he will be graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſerve in their Virginity without ſpot for ever.</p>
            <p>The Sun is now ſetting, the three Races run, and high time to repaire to lodging and reſt; Glad would I bee to underſtand <hi>Het.</hi> how you reſt ſatisfied with my Defence of theſe eight Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: but however, in your approbation of my Diſcourſe, or my contrary reſolution, I am reſolved to reſt ever at your ſervice.</p>
